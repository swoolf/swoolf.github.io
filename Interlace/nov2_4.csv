102610,1421270613,2,Week 1,"I mentioned that the salt lowered the melting and boiling points of water. What this means is the water would take longer to freeze due to its lowered melting point lower than 0 Celsius. It must also mean that salt water has more energy thus transferring its energy to the ice causing it to melt faster than ice in clean water free of salt.

I watched Donnas video and I could only see it sideways, not vertical. I did notice that the ice seemed to melt faster in salt water. It was difficult to follow.

102620,1421273261,2,Week 1,"I thought some more about this. I do know that if you add salt  to water when you boil pasta, the water will boil sooner. So this leads me to believe that salt must add energy to the water and that is why it will cause the ice to melt faster. What are your thoughts?

102631,1421280359,1,Week 1,"Hi Deanna, I didnt measure the temp of the water, it was from the tap - I filled a measuring cup to 2 cups and divided it into the two glasses.  I figured they were both the same temp.  I wasnt being very scientific in terms of setting it up and knowing all the variables, I just did what I thought would be equal in terms of temp, volume, etc.  Sorry about the video, it was on my iPhone and downloaded ok and when I click on it its right side up.  I was really close to the glasses.  The glass without the water caused the ice to melt faster, though, not the reverse.

One thing the end of the table where I sat was talking about was that salt lowers the freezing point of water - at least thats what we thought as when salt is put on a roads surface, it stops the water on the road from freezing at 32 degrees and allows the temp to be lower before it will freeze.  Some of us also talked about how the ice will melt when salt is thrown on it, so we thought maybe a reaction creating heat was occurring.

	The ice cube in the salt water was more exposed to the outside air than the freshwater ice cube.  That is, it floated higher above the waters surface.
	The salt in the water began to settle at the bottom of the glass after 15 minutes.
	After 19 minutes, condensation began to accumulate on the outside of the salt water glass.

103105,1421601328,4,Week 1,"I conducted a simple experiment on Tuesday after our course and was very surprised by the outcome. Ive been chewing on possible explanations since then and have hit a bit of a roadblock. Im eager to read peoples ideas this week to get the ball rolling!

103110,1421623511,3,Week 1,"nice job!  I still cant quite wrap my head around it - we were saying the salt melted the sidewalk ice, so how does this happen?  what is happening here?  I dont get it!!
",1
103128,1421695808,5,Week 1,"So,  I put one cup of tap water into two mugs.  I poured salt into one cup and let them sit for five hours, just so both cups would be at the same temperature.  I aded ice cubes to each and watched.  At first I didnt see much difference, It seemed they were melting at the same rate.  I then stirred the cup because the salt was concentrated at the bottom.  I watched for a total of four minutes, and the end result was the regular tap water melted the ice faster.    

When I spoke with Vesal and Lama on Friday, my hypothesis was the regular water would melt the ice faster.  I think this happens because the salt in the salt water is consumed by the water, so it does not affect the ice in the same way as it does when you put salt on the ice in your driveway. In the latter case, there are no other agents involved, just the ice and the salt.  When we are dealing with the experiment, the salt has already mixed with the water and is (for lack of a better word), occupied with the water.  

This leaves me with another question.  We know that ice melts because of heat transfer.  If the water in both the cups were at the same temperature, why didnt the ice melt at the same time.  Does salt that is occupied cause some type of block to the heat transfer?  

 
",5
103131,1421702077,6,Week 1,"I hypothesised that the ice cube would melt more quickly in the salt water.  I thought about how we use salt on the roads to help melt the ice, so I thought this would be true in the salt water cup as well.  When I did the experiment, it was clear that the ice cube melts more quickly in the fresh water.  My hypothesis was incorrect, but why?  Clearly the presence of the salt does somehting to slow down the heat transfer, but what?  I wondered if the salt created a chemical bond with the water, but I believe that salt water is a mixture (no chemical bonding) becuase it can be reversed.  I could leave the salt water out long enough to let the water vaporize and I would be left with the salt.  So, if the salt didnt chemically bond with the water, what happened that was different than in the fresh water?  The ice cube is chemically the same as the water in the cups, just in a different state.  Im also remembering about the idea that wamer water can hold more disolved salt than cooler water.  This is telling me that temperature is an important factor somehow, but both our cups had the same temperature water.  Since melting ice cubes is all about phase change and phase changes are all about temperature (heat energy) and the proximity of molecules to one another, AND temperature is not a variable difference between the two cups, then the salt must be affecting how the molecules of water move closer or farther apart.  Now, Im thinking about Bens idea (from the pre-test) of air pockets in the icecubes.  He talked about little pockets of air getting in the way of the water molecules being able to bind together more closely during its phase change from water to ice.  He used these captured air pockets to explain why frozen ice can take up more space, or expand, than it does in its liquid state (water).  If he was right (and I have no idea if he was), couldnt the salt do the same thing in our experiment?  Couldnt the salt molecules be getting in the way?  When heat travels, it goes from warmer (the water/salt water) to the cooler thing (ice cube).  As the heat leaves the water/salt water, then it will have less heat making its molecules want to move closer together.  However, if the salt molecules are in the way, or need to be moved out of the way, then this could slow down the movement of the heat from the salt water to the ice cube.  I have no idea how to test this idea.  Help.  Also, I am now confussed as to why we use salt to melt ice on our roads in the winter.

If it was true than, the salt would be helping the heat move from liquid to gas more quickly.  If salt helps to speed up heat transfer, shouldnt it help heat move from the salt water to the ice cube too in our experiment?  I might need to test the salt and boiling water for my own understanding.

I also find the fact of the salt water volume raised by a 1/2 inch when the salt was added.  This could be support of my idea that the salt molecules are getting in the way of the water molecules getting closer with cooler temperatures.  Colleen, thanks for being so detailed as you did your experiment!  I still dont get why we would use the salt on the road to melt ice if we get these results in this experiment.

The temp of the water is lowered (as Paul indicated in his experiment), so if thats the case, it would slow down the melting of the ice.  I doubt it could be that simple, though.

103326,1421784895,8,Week 1,"by Karen and Katie 

So, we thought about this question and thought that the salt water would melt faster, it just made sense considering that we know that salt is used on roads to melt ice.  We know that the principle is that the salt lowers the freezing temperature of the water when it is added to the roads so instead of the roads icing over at 32 degrees it needs to be a bit colder before it will turn to ice.  However, after watching Donna&rsquo;s video which clearly showed that the ice cube melted in the pure water faster than the salt water we needed to rethink it.  We started by thinking again how salt is applied to the roads to prevent them from freezing over.  We also considered how one could add salt to a pot of water when you boil it.  After some consideration, we agreed that the reason you add salt to pasta water is to raise the boiling temperature, it forces the water to reach a higher temperature before it starts to boil.   So, when considering these two things, adding salt to water not only reduces it freezing point it also raises its boiling point.  It allows water to stay in its liquid state for a wider range of temperatures.  So, we feel that somehow adding salt to the water insulates the water molecules and allows them to stay at their given temperature for a longer period of time.  The salt creates a barrier of sorts for the water molecules?  So, in considering the experiment, the pure water molecules are not as insulated from the ice cube as the water molecules in the salt water.  As the ice cube is dropped in the cup with the pure water, it touches the water molecules, which are warmer than the temperature of the ice cube.  At this point the ice cube begins to melt.  On the other hand, when the ice cube is dropped into the cup with the salt water, the salt creates a barrier between the ice cube and the water molecules and therefore the ice remains protected from melting for longer.  So, rather than think about it as the ice is melting faster in the pure water&hellip;we think about it as the salt water is protecting the ice from melting better than the pure water.  We also thought about the situation with an ice cream maker&hellip;a friend of ours has an ice cream maker and in order to make the cream turn to ice cream she needs to add rock salt.  There are two containers, an inside container and an outside container.  You put ice, water, and rock salt in the outside container and cream and flavor in the inside container and spin.  The salt lowers the freezing temperature of the ice water in the outside container to the point where it is lower than the freezing temperature of the cream so the cream starts to freeze. This lowering of the freezing temperature is what allows the cream to freeze&hellip;if you simply had just water and ice (no rock salt) the freezing temperature would be 0 degrees Celsius and therefore the cream would not reach its freezing point.  We are not really sure how this applies to the principle however it connected to what we were thinking about so figured we would bring it up to the group.

103520,1421891142,9,Week 1,"Greetings all!

I too ran the super simple experiment and am confuzzled by the results just like most.  I used slightly warmer than room temperature water and the fresh water cube (my freezer makes the ones that are flat on one side and rounded on the other) melted in 5 minutes.  The salt water cube melted in about 20 minutes (4 times faster!).  I am interested in how the salt water in my experiment caused the cube to melt 4 times as fast when the colder water experiment done had the salt water cube taking just twice as fast (30 minutes vs. 60 minutes.)

Thinking about the difference between the warmer water experiment I did and the cooler water experiment done by Donna, I think the salt has an effect on the ices ability to gain heat and not so much that the salt changes how much energy the water has to give.

Karen and Katies post is pretty much what I was thinking.  The salt impedes the heat transfer...like a buffer to the process somehow.

To further investigate this I suggest we test the effect salt has on other examples of heat transfer.  By being able to compare the results between cold fresh water and cold salt water vs. warm fresh water vs. warm salt water and perhaps lets say...an ice cube sitting in the air by itself and an ice cube covered in salt perhaps we can ferret out a few things...

Something about salt being an insulator and slowing the ability of the cube to absorb the warmer water. This makes sense to me.  Last night, I was chopping the ice off my driveway for the impending snow falling as I write this, and as I chopped, once I was unable to keep going, I would move to a different spot.  When I had reached my limit of chopping where I was, I again moved back to the other area to see if any more has loosened up.  It had!  And it has melted more from the bottom, not the top where I thought the sun hitting it might have melted it.  Of course it got me thinking about the salt - so I wondered if the salt (that had mixed into the ice - I hadnt put any new salt down) had somehow done something within the ice and the water that was melting the bottom allowed it to just seep under more and melt it little by little as I was chopping in another area.

I had a very similar experience to yours with my hypothesis and experiement.  I had also noticed that the two ice cubes seemed to melt at the same rate for a bit, but then the cube in the fresh water melted much faster than the one in the salt water during the second half.  I wonder if the clear vs frosted edges you observed has something to do with this.  This and Donnas ice chopping make me think about surface area, like with the mentos and diet coke experiement.  Could that be a factor here?  Maybe the frosted edge of the fresh water cube had pocket, or divets melted out of it giving it more surface area for the heat to move more quickly from the water to the ice cube?  I also had pondered if the salt in the mixture requires more energy to move the salt molecules out of the way so that the water molecules can get together to form the solid?  Lastly, Deanna did an experiement showing that the boiling point is raised by adding salt.  If you are correct that melting/freezing points are connected, then the salt cant both raise the boiling temp. and lower the freezing temp of salt water.  Are we sure that salt lowers the freezing temp of water?

The data you collected about the temp. droping 3 degrees as soon as you added salt is really helpful.  People have suspected this, but I think you were the only one who documented it.  But Im confussed because if the salt lowered the water temp. AND Deanna showed that salt increased the boiling point, how can both be true.  I always thought there was a fixed range between the boiling and melting points. They either both need to increase or both decrease, but our data is showing them moving in opposite directions??!!!??  Also, you refered to the salt water as a solution.  Im not sure if its a solution or a mixture?  Right now Im leaning toward mixture because the process can be reversed.  I can let the water evaporate and  be left with the salt.  I think this is an important point for our community to figure out because a solution would include chemical reactions affecting the heat transfer.

Here is what I know to be true having taught physical science to 8th graders for several years- I am pretty confident in this information:  The lower temperature when I added salt to liquid water is not the same thing as melting point.  Many solutes will lower the temperature as they enter into solution because they require energy to dissolve (not sure of the reason).  So,this is not the same as boiling point elevation.  Secondly, a solution IS a mixture- it is actually the most thoroughly mixed one as it is mixed at the molecular level. But once again, I cant really explain the difference in deeper terms so your questions are making me realize how much I really dont know about this phenomenon.

Did it gradually clear from bottom to top- that might indicate that it was gas bubbles.  

You mention in your conclusion how the melting point is lowered but to me this seems inconsistent with what we are observing (the ice melting slower).   If the melting point is now lower, I think the ice would melt faster such as it does with rock salt?

The end points on this graph show rapid boil temperatures. Clear water boiled rapidly at 100.0 degrees Celsius. 1/4 cup salt in water boiled at 103.2 degrees Celsius.

Very interesting idea! I guess I always assumed that if salt lowers the freezing point of water, than it must also lower its boiling point as it essentially causes a &ldquo;shift&rdquo; in waters liquid state to a lower range. I have absolutely no evidence to support this, so it has always just been my assumption! If salt does in fact lower the freezing point of water while raising its boiling point, Im very curious to explore how it does this as I cant really wrap my head around the fact that it could create a wider range of liquid state rather than just shifting it to a lower (or higher), level. I havent finished reading all posts from the week at this point to see if anyone has experimented with this yet, but Im inspired to test it out!

Im very curious how this might be the case as a directional shift seems more likely, but is clearly not the case based on the results of Donnas experiment. So, Donnas experiment concludes that as more salt is added, the boiling point of water increases, causing the water to come to a boil at a much higher temperature. Im guessing that adding salt to water has the same impact on the other end of the spectrum and that adding more salt to water will lower its freezing point more significantly until some sort of minimum possible freezing point is reached.

Thanks for conducting your experiment and graphing the results in excel. Great work! So your experiment demonstrates that adding salt to water increases its boiling point rather than decreasing it, causing the water to come to a boil at what I would guess is a much higher temperature, and that as more salt is added, the boiling point of the water increases. I wonder just how high waters boiling point can raise to when salt is added, and how much salt is required to get us to that point? On the other end of the spectrum, I wonder the same thing about the affect of salt on waters freezing point? There must be a floor at which a certain quantity of salt will no longer be able to lower the freezing point of the water any further.

103738,1422237018,4,Week 1,"Hi guys,

Thank you all so much for such great feedback! This one is really frying my brain! I love the driveway-ice-chopping parallel, Donna! Ive noticed the same thing when removing ice from my driveway, and I like your idea of the salt acting as a sort of insulator.  Katie and Karen posted about salt acting as a barrier between the ice and water molecules, and I am very interested to see where this might lead us as it seems very plausible given our observations, Im just not sure what might be going on at the molecular level that would cause salt to act as a barrier/insulator.

Jenn, the more I think about it, I guess Im really not sure that salt does in fact definitely reduce the freezing point of water. I guess it is just a deeply ingrained assumption that I have always held onto! This should be a pretty easy one to experiment with and I am very curious, so Ill try to make some salty ice cubes and observe as quantifiably as possible in the coming days!

Interesting idea! Ive done experiments with ice cubes in years past and crushed ice melts and cools water substantially faster than larger ice cubes. Perhaps there is a similar phenomenon happening here, but, as you mentioned, the salt water is somehow smoothing the surface of the cube. In this sense, I can definitely see that the ice cube in plain water would have more surface area due to its pocked surface, and as such, would melt faster. Now Im curious to see the rate at which the temperature of each glass of water decreases. Im guessing that since the ice cube in fresh water melts faster than the ice cube in salt water, that the temperature of the fresh water will decrease much more quickly?

103743,1422272156,13,Week 1,"Just a quick comment - I was watching the weather channel this morning and Al Roker was saying that the salt they throw on the pavement before a storm allows for the temperature to be lower before precipitation freezes, meaning it will take a longer period of time for it to ice over with a lower temp - say 20 minutes for 30 degrees, the lower the temp goes the sooner the ice will happen.

I am really trig to understand why ice melts in freshwater rather than the salt water. What does the salt do to slow down the melting process?

I want to make sure I am reading your results correctly. Are you saying that the ice melted faster in the freshwater or the saltwater?  I am going to assume you mean it melted faster in the freshwater (as this is what happened in my experiment and in Colleens).

I too believe the salt acts a an agent to impede the ice melting in this process.  However I do not understand how salt melts ice on our driveways.  Maybe because in our experiment we exposed the ice to a mixture of salt and water, and when we use salt on our driveways we are exposing salt directly to the ice?  Maybe the in our experiment the water is occupied with the salt, and the salt cant do its thing, so to speak.

Our hypothses were completely different. Both Katie and I were positive the ice would melt faster in the salt water. We were certain it would melt because of the connection we made to using salt to melt the ice on the roads and sidewalks. Unfortunately we did not do the experiment. We are going to do the experiment next week. I am looking forward to comparing our observations with you. With that being said, you brought up some thoughts that got me thinking. You stated that perhaps the water consumed the salt and therefore had no effect on the ice. It got me thinking that maybe because we do in fact put the salt directly on the ice thats why it melts. I wonder if the salt water acts as a buffer and it slows down the ice melting.

My hypothesis was identical to yours. Both Katie and were sure we were right, we even connected it to salting the roads and sidewalks. It made sense. We didnt do the experiment. Based on everything Ive read the outcome was the same. The ice melted faster in the freshwater. I am still confused why but, when reading Tonyas thoughts they made me wonder. We apply the salt directly to our roads and sidewalks, step back and watch it melt. In the experiment you did, you allow the salt to dissolve in the water. It doesnt come into direct contact with the ice. Does this new mixture create a barrier or buffer? Im not sure. I am convinced that the new salt water mixture has something to do with it.  I just am not sure about the why ad how. As far as your question about why we use rock salt to melt ice, I did see somewhere that not all rock salt melts ice. Some types do in fact melt ice. I wonder if it is because of how its applied.

I am going to disagree on what is happening at the particle level.  I am also not sure of my statement here but what I believe I have learned is that salt does, in fact, disassociate the two ions and they all exist freely in solution as the electrons are being shared- hence the increase in conductivity with an electrolyte.

104207,1422918528,8,Week 3,"I had planned on doing the experiment with the different amounts of salt in the water - Deanna did the experiment before I got to it, so I looked at her results.  A question that came up for me was the water temperatures.  If the salt waters temperature was lowered due to the salt being put into it when all the glasses initially had the same temp, then wouldnt that slow down the melting?  Though its not a significant temperature difference, 68 - 60 in plain water compared to 65 - 57 (using the two extremes - plain water compared to super salty with a cup of salt, there is a difference).  The ice is in the 68 degree plain water vs. the ice in the 65 degree salty water (a 3 degree difference throughout the experiment) - so my question was in regards to the temperature difference of the water - ice would melt it faster in the plain water as the temperature of the water was higher at the beginning (and throughout) the experiment.  My question with this experiment was about the temperature of the water once the salt was put in - I wondered if melting would occur differently if the temperature was allowed to equalize.  Before I could do the experiment, I read what Paul had done.  He seemed to cover this idea with his experiment, so I didnt see the need to redo that either!  What I did see as a difference in what I believed was the convection piece that Paul came up with.  He found that the density of the salt water was standing in the way of the warmer water at the bottom of the glass (under the water cooling from the ice cube being in it) moving upward.  We are currently studying convection currents in the mantle, and knowing that a fluid, when warmed, rises and conversely, as it cools, it sinks explains how this could be the solution to the problem.  So in Pauls experiment, the cool water was unable to sink due to the density of the salty water, and the warm water was unable to rise as quickly.  I am still wondering about the insulation piece.  Does the density act an insulator?  Can it be explained that way?  If that is the case, then I believe this is the solution.

Then I got it - at least I think I did.  I think it makes a lot of sense that with more surface area, the melting would occur much faster than with individual large ice cubes.  If I were going to explain this to my 6th graders, how could I explain it so that they would understand it at their level?  I did pose the question in class - they have made their ideas of the answers known (most believed what we believed), but I told them they had to explain it and support why.  I dont know that I could bring it to their level with this explanation.  I still am confused with the insulation piece.  I had a feeling insulation, on some level, had to be occurring, I just couldnt figure out how it could be occurring.  Paul did an experiment with the idea of convection and density and this made much more sense.  I am going to experiment using colored ice cubes.  This would bring home the idea of convection.  What are your thoughts with this?  Cold water is denser, so it would sink, warm is less dense so it should rise.  This is what should occur, and does in the plain water, but does so, but not as rapidly, in the salt water.  The density of the salt water is higher, so it slows the process down.  Could this be considered a type of insulation?  I would think so.

I really appreciate the way that you are so diligent about looking at all the other investigations going on and weaving them together for your next step.  I am beginning to understand this &ldquo;mini-scientific community&rdquo; that Vesal is referring to.   You questioned the starting temps of the different containers.  Yes, I also agree that a simple 2 degree difference could easily account for a significantly faster ice melt.  When I read the other investigations I was under the assumption that folks were letting the temperatures stabilize/equalize prior to testing but perhaps this is something that we should probe directly at our next meeting? 

You ask the question if &ldquo;density acts as an insulator&rdquo;.   I am unclear what you mean.  Are you asking if denser water alone &ldquo;insulates&rdquo; or keeps it from melting?   In our tests we are observing water that is more dense from two different causes:  one is the dissolved salt and the other way that density is increased is by lowering temperature.  So yes, in effect by lowering temperature and making the water denser it melts slower and this happens because less heat transfers away from the ice.  On the other hand it is not because there is less ability to conduct heat, there is only less energy available to conduct into the ice cube.

As I was reading your comments and wondering about next tests- I thought perhaps if we used colored water ice then we could watch the convection that we are both talking about.  I think it will stay on top and if we measure the temp that will show us where the colder water is sitting.

I dont have thermometers here at home, so I used tap water and let the glasses sit for about 5 hours.  I place one ice cube in a glass with plain water, and the other in a glass with salt water (each wine glass had 2 cups of water, the one with the salt had 1 tablespoon of salt).  I put the salt into the water when I first put the water into the glasses and dissolved it, then evened the amount of water in the glasses.

105030,1423494677,10,Week 3,"Hi Girls,

Paul directed me to your post - I just duplicated this yesterday not knowing you had already done it!  I found the same results -  I did a slow motion video that clearly shows the blue cube melting - almost looks like smoke from a fire - so cool to see - and the cup with the salty water didnt have much happening.  I like your take on whats going on.  It makes sense that with the ice cube melting into the plain water, the temp would lower throughout the water evenly, allowing the ice cube to continue to melt more rapidly than the ice cube in the salty water.  With the salty water, the cube melts, thought not as quickly because the colder water is not moving throughout the rest of the water, the temp of the water stays colder surrounding the ice cube.  Paul suggested that the density of the water (as proven in your experiment as well) has everything to do with how quickly the ice cube melts.  Salt is increasing the density of the water, not allowing the cold water to sink, so the temperature of the water remains colder at the top which effects the rate at which the ice cube melts.  This could be illustrated with icebergs also.  Because of the salty ocean water, the icebergs melt occurs slowly (if at all) because the water surrounding it remains extremely cold due to not being able to sink into the ocean below.

I know we initially (at least at the end of the table I was sitting at) were thinking the salty water would melt the ice quicker because salt on ice melts the ice.  We also thought about icebergs and wondered why they didnt melt.  We couldnt make sense of that.  Looking at that now, it makes sense that the icebergs dont melt due to the water surrounding them being very cold and that water not sinking as the density of the water below doesnt allow for it to occur.  I think were on our way to getting a pretty good handle on things!

105032,1423496548,13,Week 3,"Hi Greg,

Interesting that the sugar slowed the process even more so than the salt.  Things brings me to a new question in what Ive been tossing around - density of the water.  Paul suggested that the density of the water is higher due to the salt being in it.  I (we) think this is what is stopping the cold water (from the melted ice cube) from lowering into glass at the same rate as the plain water.  I took a video of melting a blue ice cube into both plain and salted water, and it is clear how the plain water allows the melting ice cubes water to lower into the glass and the salty water does not.  But my question now is why sugar slows this process even more?  New experiment!!  I think I will try melting colored ice cubes into salt and sugar water.  We know the plain water melts faster, so I think finding out why the sugar makes this occur at an even slower rate is fascinating.

105034,1423506313,10,Week 3,"Karen and Katie,

I really enjoyed reading about the experiment that you conducted last week! Ive been pretty much stuck on the idea of salt somehow acting as an insulator that reduces the ability of an ice cube to absorb heat from the surrounding water, and my experiment last week didnt really go far enough to shed any new light on a mechanism that might explain this (at least for me!). Reading through the second half of your experiment was pretty eye opening to me. If the water that melted from the blue ice cube remained in close proximity with the melting ice cube in the saltwater, then it makes perfect sense to me that the water immediately surrounding the ice cube will be colder than the rest of the saltwater in the glass. This seems to explain how/why the ice cube in salt water requires a longer amount of time to melt than an ice cube in fresh water. I am also curious about the potential temperature differences that you mentioned in your next steps, and I think that you make a reasonable prediction given what you have observed so far.

Another thing that I found interesting is the fact that the cold water from the melting ice cube remained at the surface of the salt water. I would expect cold water to sink to the bottom of the glass as it should be more dense than the salt water. I guess the density of the salt water is greater than that of the cold water that results from the ice melting.

105036,1423507553,3,Week 3,"Hi Deanna,

Very interesting that you observed such significant differences in starting water temperature after letting the salt sit in the water for an hour. Paul had commented on this in an earlier post and Im still a bit confused about this as Ive always believed changes in temperature to be indicative of a chemical change. I know that mixing two substance that have different starting temperatures can result in overall temperature changes in the mixture, but I would have to imagine that the salt we all use is stored at room temperature as well. I think you were on the right track using the quantities of salt that you used in your experiment. I tried using lower quantities in my experiment (approximately 1, 2, and 3 tablespoons, respectively), and I do not think that it provided enough saturation as the results of my experiment indicated that more salt doesnt necessarily equate to a slower rate of melting (something we all know not to be accurate based on our collective experiments!).

105037,1423509094,1,Week 3,"Chris, Ive only read your revised thoughts doc so far as Im responding.  Im in agreement with how you are thinking about surface area and salt being an insulator.  Your explination of why you were choosing your experiment this week was dead on with what I was wondering about as well.  I tried to do an exeriment on the same topic, got really unlogicial results, and later realized, I need to run a cleaner experiment.  Because you did the same thing I was trying, Im very anxious to see your results.  I do have some questions about your thoughts here though.  You use the word adhere to reference how the individual NaCl molecules stay together before they disolve in the water.  I think we need to understand more at this level.  What makes them adhere to one another?  Why do they only adhere in small, grain size chunks and not a whole solid?  What happens in the water to make them unadhere?  Do they just break apart from other NaCl molecules and float sperate or do they bond with the water molecules?  Im thinking if the NaCl molecules bonded with the water molecules in a specific way, they could litterally insulate the water molecule (like a coating of plastic over live wires).  If there was less salt, then the water molecules might not each have enough NaCl molecules to fully insulate them changing the rate of heat transfer.  What do you think? Im just spitballing here.

OK, just read your experiment and am now fired up!!!  I did do four glasses with the fresh water control, but I also got the weird data that my highest salt concentration melted the fastest of all the salt water concentrations, only second to the fresh water control.  This totally messed up my thinking.  I did large amounts of salt to water ratios and had undissolved salt in all of my glasses.  This is what I thought messed up my data, but you got the same strange results!  I had also found that my highest concentration of saltwater maintained the same temp. through the whole thing, but even with the highest temp. didnt melt the most quickly.  The freshwater ice cube, with the lowest temp melted the fastest.  When I read Pauls experiemtn and findings this week, I think hes on to something with the density and convection currents.  This would mean that where we measure the temp. does matter.  Im also thinking that your ideas about salt as an insulator and needing to better understand at the molecular level are all parts that need to fit together somehow.

Very thorough response.  I appreciate how you were attempted to understand the situation by looking closely at the situation at the molecular level.  In your paper, you refer to how Jenn brought up the idea of the surface of the ice having an impact on the rate of absorption of thermal energy but then you go on to discuss how the surface area of the salt also may play a role.  Do you think that it is the surface area of the ice cube or the salt&hellip;or both??

Thank you for conducting your experiment&hellip;why do you think that the ice cube in the two containers with the similar amount of salt melted at close to the same point compared to the one with the least amount of salt which melted the fastest? After thinking about what we saw in the blue ice cube experiment where the water from the blue ice cube stayed at the surface in the salt-water mixture&hellip;do you think that the water from the melting ice cube mixed differently with the salt/water mixture in each cup?  I mean&hellip;do you think that the water from the melting ice cube floated more in the two cups with more salt than the cup with less salt?  Also, do you think that the results in the two cups may have had similar results because the water had reached its saturation point and no matter how much salt was in the cup, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter because the water could not dissolve any more salt into it?

I like how you looked at how adding different substances to water affected the rate at which the ice cube melted.  I also appreciate how you took the temperature as you went.  Now that we have seen the blue ice cube experiment which shows that the water from the melting ice cube stays at the surface of the salt water mixture&hellip;.I wonder if we did the experiment with these other mixtures we would see similar results.  I mean, I wonder if adding sugar and baking soda also would increase the density of the water mixture so that when the ice cube melts the water from the melting ice cube stays at the surface of the water which lowers the temperature at the surface of the water(around the ice cube) which slows the melting of the ice cube.

I see that you took the temperatures, but I am curious how the temperature differed (if it did) between the surface of these mixtures and the bottom of the mixture.

This video was pretty cool!  I cant believe it took me this long to figure this one out.  I am on the density train, but I cannot agree to the insulation piece or agree that the salt acts ike a barrier for the ice.  Paul tested the temperatures and I tested the sugar, and it now makes sense why the ice in sugar melted even slower than the ice in the salt.  It isnt about the salt or the sugar it is about the way fluids act!  I proposed a question in class, and I wonder your thoughts.  The ice didnt melt as fast because of the dense liquid at the bottom, but it did eventually melt.  Why? Did the convection current stop only for the deep bottom and now there is current happening from the middle to the top? I keep watching your video, and if my eyes are not laying tricks on me, I see a blue line (very faint indicating melting) but it doesnt hit the bottom. What do you think?
",5
105272,1423682383,1,Week 3,"Chris-

The idea that the NaCl molecules stick together is an idea that I had not thought about. Each grain represents the clumping (or adhesions) of molecules When the salt dissolves that physical property does not change the characteristic properties, yet what causes that barrier you described? Could this have to do with the molecular structure or does it have to do with the distribution of the salt particles within the water? I am interested in the ratio of salt to water. I have read multiple experiments where the amount of salt to water is varied. Does this bring up the idea of density. The higher the salt content, the higher the density of the solution. Is this the barrier that you mentioned? I would be interested to find out how much of a factor it makes on the melting rate.

I went for the same experiment myself.  I did sugar water, fresh water, and salt water.  The sugar took the longest just like your experiment.  I like that you brought in the thermometers into the mix.  This really does bring up the idea about how the temperature gradient in the sugar water is clearly larger making you think that the ice cube in the sugar water should melt faster because of the larger temperature difference between the sugar water and ice cube...but alas...it does not.  I thought of the same question as you...thinking about if temperature difference has been ruled out as the mechanism then is the mechanism causing this at the molecular level and the solutes causing some kind of interference with the heat swapping with the solutions and the ice cube.

Hi Jen,

It was great to compare results/observations of your experiment with ours seeing they were similar. I was intrigued by your observation of the affect the salt had on the opaqueness and clarity of the ice as it melted. I didnt pick up on that. It made me wonder what caused that and was it a direct relation to how quickly the ice cube melted. You mentioned bubbles that were present in the salt water. Particularly on the bottom and in the middle as compared to the bubbles in the fresh water being throughout as well but concentrated in the middle and top. I wonder what/if the bubbles had anything to do with the rate of the ice cube melting. Was there gas being released? It may seem like I am rambling but the more I think about this the more confused I get as well. What I think I know does not seem to be the case. I think I might do this experiment again over vacation to see what happens this time.

105458,1423710678,3,Week 3,"Hi Deanna,

Our results were similar, Katie and I used a large amount of salt as well. We also noticed that some of the salt was not dissolved completely in the cup. We wondered what impact that would have on the melting rate. We also assumed that the temperature of the water after we added the salt would be the same temperature. Boy were we wrong. We did get them to the same temperature (66 degrees) but that took ALL day. We also considered freezing salt water but didnt think it would freeze or it would take too long. I am curious to see what happens if in fact you do this what the results might be. Keep us posted.

105474,1423737611,10,Week 3,"The blue ice cubes really help to illustrate the affect of the melting ice cube. I wonder if you had taken temperature readings at the top of the glass versus the bottom would show any difference. My guess is yes based on the conclusion drawn on your experiment. The temperature readings throughout the experiment might also help determine the rate at which the temperature in the cup itself changes. The cup of salty water slowed down the mixing process of the melting blue cube from spreading into the solution. It does seem like it is acting like an insulator. Thinking about why specific materials are used to insulate, it makes me think about how energy moves through materials at rate due to their state of matter. Heat moves faster through a solid than a liquid. So if the density of the solution is increased it makes sense that the molecules in the solution are closer together and  will slow down or inhibit the rate of movement of particles due to the temperature change.

VD1-  Yes, Vesal.  I was originally thinking that increasing the exposure of more of the ice cube to the apparent melt-retarding effect of salt would make the ice cube last even longer.   I end up reversing this idea, however, later in the investigation.

VD2- Yes, my evidence is the shape of the ice.  In salt water it forms a thin ice disk resting in the surface layer of what looks like fresh water.  The ice that is in completely fresh water seems to melt all the way around because it does not flatten out.  It only gets smaller.

VD3- Let me make a minor correction to your interpretation: What I meant to communicate is that the ice in the salt water melts SLOWER because it actually is sitting in a layer of cold fresh water above the salt water.   You are correct in stating that I do not support the claim strongly there, however, my next move was to re-test based on my newly formed hypothesis.  In the second test the ice is held beneath the surface with a wooden stick.  The evidence is that the melt time for this one submerged in salt is close to the ice floating in fresh water.   Additionally, the ice submerged in salt water did not form the same flat disk that it formed when it floated in salt water.

106047,1424264905,6,Week 5,"My initial thoughts this week...

 

After trying to absorb and connect all of the facts and ideas weve come up with as a community, I am definitely on board with the idea that salt works as an insulator.  Let me explain why.  Im imagining that the NaCl molecules surround (encapsulate) the water molecules.  This would mean that fully saturated salt water would have every water molecule fully encapsulated by NaCl molecules.  Salt water that is not fully saturated would have water molecules with NaCl adhered to them, but there still would be holes in the NaCl covering of the individual water molecules.  As more salt that is added to the mixture, the new NaCl molecules would fill in these holes around the water molecules.  Because weve noted that there is a temperature drop when salt is added to fresh water, this leads me to believe that there must be some type of heat needed at the molecular level to allow the NaCl molecules to adhere to the water molecules.  The more thoroughly a water molecule is encapsulated with NaCl molecules, the more it is insulated and thereby restricted/blocked from giving its heat away.  This thought connects to the data that fresh water gives its heat away much more quickly than salt water.  We have also seen that the greater the amount of salt in the mixture, the more stable the temperature is.  Again, suggesting insulation.  This could also explain why the salt mixture with the least amount of salt (and lower temp) could melt the ice more quickly than the salt mixture with more salt (and a higher temp).  I couldnt get my head around that last week and this is the only way I can get the pieces to make sense.  To take it one step further, some people have talked about salt water having a higher conductivity than fresh water.  I think this idea could help explain that as well.  The more encapsulated the water molecules are (the more salt in the solution) then the current can travel more easily from NaCl to NaCl molecules without encountering the holes to the water molecules that get in the way of the electrical flow.  What I am curious about is how convection currents were observed by some and others observed density columns.  Why did the fresh, cold water from the ice cube melt convect in some cases and not in others.  With the idea I noted above, I would expect to see convection currents if the water is less saturated with salt and no convection currents if the salt water is more fully saturated.  Id like to do an experiment with a colored ice cube and a different colored fully saturated salt water to see if the colors combine or stay separate.

I am still on the fence with the density - just when I think I have it figured out somewhat, the insulation piece comes back into play again.  I like your idea of the holes being there.

106138,1424351160,6,Week 5,"Donna,

Youre idea of less holes = more dense and more holes = less dense makes sense to me.  More holes, would also equal fewer NaCl molecules surrounding a water molecule, so that makes sense to be less dense.  Maybe that is why I got density layers with the salt water.  The NaCl was trying to spread around into the newly intoduced fresh water from the ice cube.  Depending on how much salt moves into the area of fresh water would varrying amounts of holes = varrying amounts of density.  This could also explain your temp results.

106139,1424351610,5,Week 5,"Chris,

It seems that sugar water and salt water react approximately the same.  I think this is more evidence that these materials are acting as insulators.  Since the color stayed at the top of the sugar water with a clear boundary, this is evidence that the heat did not move from the sugar water into the cooler ice melt colored water.  That means that even at a cooler temp, the fresh water is still less dense than the sugar water and something about the sugar water blocks the heat transfer.  Im with you, Im trying to figure out what is happening at the molecular level to better understand all of this.

What an awesome experiment!  I agree with your results, but it also gives data to the concept that cooler liquids have greater density.  This trend just barely started with your fresh and sugar water at the 60 degree mark, but Id be really curious to see more of what happens as the temperature continues to drop.  I find it interesting that the density of the saltwater didnt change at all.  More evidence of insulation?

106201,1424394673,8,Week 5,"Vesal !  As usual, you have uncovered some inconsistencies in my statements which I did not communicate well.  I hope it did not confuse too many readers. Allow me to clarify:

Gradient- yes, when I used that word it is to describe the separation of the brine and the melt water.

10% solution of salt &amp;amp; sugar- it was, in fact, 10%.  I did not correctly report the solute mass of 20 g in each 200 ml beaker. (I had the number 10 in my head but my handwritten notes support 20 in 200 for 10%)

In my conclusion I used degrees instead of g/ml.  I meant the density unit. Thanks for catching that.

Finally, the reason that I picked the temperature range that I did was because I have measured the melt water temperature during the previous round and found it to be only about 2-3 &deg;C  lower (4-5&deg;F).  I reference this in my conclusion of week 3.  I think next test I will get a similar data set for temperatures at different levels of test beakers.  Keep in mind, we are wondering if it will exceed the density of the salt solution (1.07) and not the sugar (1.04).

I like this investigation. It demonstrates density and particle speed, It does appear that salt impedes the flow of convection currents as the blue ice mixed more thoroughly with fresh water than salt water. It also seems that density decreased the flow of convection as there was a much faster dispersal of color in the hot water than the cold water. Cold water is more dense than warm water and the particles move much faster and are less dense in warm water. Its like the atmosphere, warm air rises over cold dense air. So this makes me think that the salt impedes the movement of water particles and maybe thats why the color moved faster and easier in fresh water. So salt is blocking the natural mojo of water particles. Maybe this is insulating, like wrapping baby water in a blanket?

I will also take a look at the temp of the layers all the way to the bottom of the cups - in my initial experiment, I didnt have them all the way to the bottom.  I will also use warmer water before adding the salt in the hopes that the salt mixes better and wait for the water to all come to room temp.  Well see what happens.  Im still thinking density, but I cant let go of the imsulation piece - I dont know what keeps me hanging on to it!  I am thinking if the water on the bottom remains constant in the salty and saltiest glasses, this may sway me toward the density side for sure.

I appreciate that you reworked your original experiment to better understand how the density of different temperatures of water interact in fresh vs. salt water.  I also like your follow up ideas for another experiment.  From reading different results, it seems, so far, that even though the ice cube melted water is cooler than the salt water below it, it is the salt water vs. fresh water that determines the ultimate density.  We know that temperature has a role with density, but as you put it, it doesnt overcome the density of the salt water.  Weve also seen that the salt water doesnt want to share its heat with the cooler ice melt water as readily as the fresh water.  I am on the salt is an insulator band wagon and I see support for that in your experiment.  Im really looking forward to your next experiment to see if less salt will alter your results or will they be similar?
",6
106262,1424618753,11,Week 5,"Hi Tonya, just a couple of questions - the start temps were different on all the glasses of water - so for this, were these the temps after the ice cubes were added or before?  If it was before, was it due to adding the sugar and salt?  I did a very similar experiment, but in my sugar and salt mixtures I only added 1 tablespoon of each (salt and sugar) and used 2 cups of water.  So looking at the two experiments, it seems your results were dramatically different than mine which brings me to the amount of salt/sugar being used.  Your experiment had much more salt/sugar and your results in drops of temp was much less dramatic so does this mean there is some kind of insulative (is that a word?) properties going on?  Because there was more sugar and salt in the water, the ice did not melt as fast and when it did the temperature difference was not as great.    I also had a much less dramatic difference in the ice being melted - but I use a different kind of ice - I freeze 1/4 cup of water with food coloring in cupcake tins, so I have one big ice cube.  Which brings me to a different questions which Paul (or Chris? I confuse the two) talked about - your experiment used 3 ice cubes in each glass to my one big piece of ice and your ice was almost gone - where after 20 minutes, both my sugar and salt mixture had the ice cube remaining and it was pretty close in volume.  So do the smaller pieces of ice melt quicker than the one large cube?  UGH!!!!!  Now I have more questions than answers!!  I have ice cubes at home freezing as I type this and glasses of salt water cooling to room temp since last night.  I will post the results later.

After reading your post, I the density of the solution slows down the transfer of energy. So I wonder how much of difference there is in the density of the salt solution versus the sugar solution. The transfer energy moves from particle to particle so the more particles, the longer it takes for the energy to move. This also makes me think about conductivity. Jen mentioned it and it made me stop and think that could be another piece to the puzzle.How much of difference in time was the melting of the ice cube in the salt solution and the sugar solution? When I did it, I found that there was a difference between the two, but it was slight. I am also curious about amounts. How much of a saturated mixture did you have? I experimented with different percents of salt, because I questioned whether or not it mattered once the water reached its saturation point of salt. The rest falls to the bottom of the cup and the results showed tenths of a difference in temperature.  
",10
106498,1424728850,9,Week 5,"Jen-

I tried different concentrations of salt, because I was curious how much of a difference the concentration will or will not make. Maybe this can help to explain the difference between cup 2 and 3 in your experiment? When the water becomes saturated with salt, I found that the melting process slowed down. What I found was that there was a difference of a few minutes between a 5% and 10% solution, but only a slight difference from a 10% to 20 % solution. As the heat transfers through the mixture, the denser the solution the longer it takes for that to occur. I could be totally wrong about this, but I think of it as particles passing something from particle to particle. The more particles, the longer it takes. Questions to ponder, Is there a saturation point that the salt solution reaches that makes little difference to melting? Or does the layer of salt on the bottom of the cup make a difference? You brought up the idea of conductivity, which I did not think of. Is salt a better conductor than another substance? If it is, what about all the excess salt at the bottom of the cup? Does it help with the melting process (transfer of energy)?

I realized now that you had two posts, so I got the answer to the temperature difference. After looking at the data, how saturated was the solution? Was it all dissolved or was there excess at the bottom of the glass? I am curious because does the concentration make a difference in melting rate. Is more better?

I wonder if the water that rests on top of the salt or sugar solutions (the product of the ice cube melting), is the same temperature as the rest of the water that was measured in your experiment? If the water that results from the ice cube melting is significantly cooler than the water in the solution, is there a possibility that it would sink through the solution to the bottom of the glass? Based on your data I suppose it would depend on how cold the water from the melted ice cube becomes. My thought is that the water would be very close to its freezing point, so I wonder how its density compares to the densities of the solutions at each respective temperature? Very nice experiment and I appreciate the food for thought that it offered.

My initial thought upon reading your paper was that the ambient heat in the air surrounding the ice cube would have an impact on the melting rates of the two cubes, but upon re-reading, I understand that you noticed that the ice cube with the salt on it &lt;em&gt;initially &lt;/em&gt;melted at a significantly faster rate than the ice cube with no salt at the same room temperature. What I really appreciate about your experiment is the fact that it really brought me back to thinking about how salt interacts with ice at the molecular level. Your experiment demonstrates that salt must be in direct contact with ice in order to cause rapid initial melting, while salt water solution inhibits the rate of melting. What your experiment really has me wondering is does the cold &ldquo;meltwater&rdquo; that appears to remain on the surface of the salt/sugar solution have any significant impact on the melting rate of the ice? The experiment that I conducted this week yielded a minor difference in temperature between surface and bottom of the solution (about 1.5 degrees), and I&rsquo;m now second-guessing whether this rather small change in temperature can have such a significant impact on the rate of melting?

I thought this was strange because I got results which were not at all like this, The temperature of water with ice in any situation was colder on the bottom. Im not sure what was happening at all in this experiment. I realize that the density might play a part in the temperature gradient, but I didnt expect this for results. I am going to check the temperature change of pure salt and sugar after removing it from my freezer. They have been there for about  week. I hope that looking at the change in temperature in pure form might shed some light on this whole idea of melting faster in one solution rather than another. I will keep you posted.

I have been playing around with the idea that the density of the salt water mixture is what causes the ice melt to remain at the surface of the water.  I see that you found that the pure water at 60 degrees would be 1.01 g/ml which is less dense than the salt water solution at the same temp.  However, do you think it would be possible to create a salt water solution that is less dense than the ice melt.  I mean&hellip;do you think that if you included less salt (just enough that the ice melt barely floats at the surface) and then increased the temperature of that liquid(thus maybe decreasing the density) and then added an ice cube&hellip;do you think the density of the ice melt water could be greater than the lightly salted water?

I am intrigued by the results of your experiment&hellip;how applying salt directly to the ice makes the ice cube melt quickly but then the melting slows after a little bit.  It lost you a little on the energy transfer&hellip;but your response make me think again about the ice cream maker.  Yes, when the salt is added it must be doing something to lower the temperature of the salt/water mixture.

107024,1424871820,5,Week 5,"Hi Chris,

 I like how you decided to change gears and explore other possible ideas. In doing our experiments we had some of the same thoughts you did. The salt must in some way be blocking/insulating the ice cube and slowing down the melting process. Specifically how, still remains a mystery to me. After reading your first paragraph under The Experiment, I was wondering if you had an idea in mind as to what you thought was going to happen before you actually did your experiment. I stopped reading at this point to hypothesize what I thought might happen. I wondered if sugar would have the same impact on the melting rate and for no specific reason I thought it would. The only reason I thought this was because the salt had an impact. I also wondered if the color would be suspended at the top like it was in the salt water. I continued to read on. You made an interesting observation regarding where the sugar was stored and whether that had an influence. I wonder how much our variables make an impact on what we are doing, seeing most of these are probably done in our kitchens at home. I was still surprised at your outcome even though I thought that the fresh water would have a faster melting rate. Your results were similar to ours. In your outcome you noted the difference in temperature between the solution on the bottom and at the surface. Ironically, Katie and I did not take the temperatures at the bottom and top. We submerged the thermometer completely in the solution. So, over vacation we decided to test this. Would there be a difference in temperatures between the bottom and the top. Our results were similar. There was not a significant difference in the temperatures. The temperature at the top was 46 degrees Fahrenheit and the bottom was 50 degrees Fahrenheit. My thoughts now are&hellip;&hellip; will any substance added to fresh water have an impact on the melting rate? Is energy now being used to dissolve what has been added to the fresh water instead of causing the ice cube to melt?

107175,1424887560,12,Week 5,"Hi Becky, 

I agree with you that the density of the solution factors into the melt rate, but you really got me thinking when you talked about the difference in temperature between the water particles and the air particles and how the air particles move toward the solution in the cup. Just this past week when responding to Vesals comments Katie and I started to think about whether or not the air in the room affects the melting rate. I followed most of what you were saying about the exchange between the air particles and water particles. I am wondering if you seal the cup somehow so the air particles could not come in contact with the water particles  if the results would change?

In your last paragraph you wrote about the denser the substance (salt water) the slower the melt rate. As soon as you mentioned (the more tightly packed it is) it became clear. Of course this makes sense, Im assuming because its packed more tightly it will require more energy/time to melt.

I have been having several similar thoughts that you expressed in your paper.  I have been thinking of ways both matter and energy move to areas of higher concentration to lower concentration.  You described how an ice cube is a heat sink quite well and that&rsquo;s part of how I&rsquo;ve been seeing things.  The heat goes from outside the cube to the cube and from outside the glass to the glass.

 

The comment &ldquo;the more particles, the more movement or passing occurs from one particle to another&rdquo; really rung with me as I envisioned the sun (I know I know&hellip;that&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch&hellip;but its what I thought).  The sun takes a million years to make a photon and then have it finally escape&hellip;its just that big and dense.  The idea that something that is denser seems to make intuitive sense in that the more &ldquo;heat hand offs&rdquo; the longer it takes.

 

I am baffled by some of your results as well.  I&rsquo;ve seen it in another experiment in the forum.  The fresh water gets the coldest, the saltiest dropped a few degrees, and the 5% solution barely changed temperature&hellip;wow&hellip;whats up here?
",9
107217,1424909394,5,Week 5,"Chris,

 

Your launching point in your first paragraph was a starting point for me to.  Do the molecules of NaCl somehow obstruct the ability of the ice cube to absorb thermal energy from the water? And I of coarse am struggling with the same issue of of coarse not being able to see what is happening at the molecular level to help with this.

 

When you mentioned the bag of sugar being at a lower temperature I would love to know how much colder it was.  If its colder it would chill the water of coarse, but should it be a 1 degree drop due to temperature differences between solute and solvent, or is it the fast that something was dissolved at all that caused the temperature drop.  I have been pondering this same point myself in my own paper.  Does a solid dissolving into a liquid require heat from the liquid as it goes from the solid state to the dissolved state, not that sugar is necessarily a liquid at room temperatures, but that some bonds were broken when the solid was broken up and the breaking of those bonds took energy.

 

I liked the results with the food colored ice cubes.  It shows that although colder water is denser, colder fresh water is still less dense than salty water!

 

I&rsquo;ve thought about the temperature differences within a glass and tried stirring to see if it made a difference.  Both ice cubes melted faster due to the stirring, but the fresh water cube still melted faster.  I only did that experiment as one of three quick experiments I did early on all in the same week.  I bet it could be done with more controls to better see if the temperature differences between the top and bottom have an impact.

108808,1425765771,10,Week 7,"Tonya, this is similar to what I drew, except I used piglets to describe it.  I agree, the water is more dense around the ice cube once it begins to melt, so being more dense it moves to the bottom.  The warmer water is pushed up and the current begins and continues until an equilibrium - temperature-wise - is reached.  Cant get to why the denser water sinks.  If the ice cube is dense, then why doesnt it sink?  I know air is inside it which gives it some floating ability.

108813,1425811037,3,Week 7,"OK Vesal,  I can see your line of questioning regarding my extended metaphor model.

First, in order for this mechanism to work, I will have to stipulate that the pennies, which represent units of energy, don&rsquo;t really have mass themselves.  And, I can now see where I am going to get into trouble because I am making claims about how they transfer between pig by using the concepts of inertia- (pennies transfer when pigs bump). This would require mass- so my model struggles here.

Regarding the mosh pit analogy:  I have never been in one (being 54, they did not exist when I was of age)  My son used to speak of them and it sounded like the more wild they got, then the more spread out people became so they would not get hit.  Therefore the more motivated pigs get with massless pennies, the more they spread out.

I have not yet put a value on how many pennies it takes for a pig to break loose and fly.  That will have to be a measurement taken at a future thought experiment.

108790,1425738277,1,Week 8,"Confirmation consensus.

I totally agree with Chris and Donna that the cold more dense particles are gravitating downward and pushing the less dense warmer particles to the top. I was exploring the PHet simulation and it only reinforces my belief in this. The particles of any substance always start at the bottom when they are colder and closer together. This appears to give them more weight, thus heavier particles settle on the bottom. With all the experiments we all did , we seem to agree that cooler dense particles move to the bottom of the solutions, no matter what. It was evident in everything we all did. Salt or no salt.
",2
108791,1425738997,1,Week 8,"Just a note. When I said; Start at the bottom I meant that the particles are closer together thus taking up less space, reduced volume, and increasing density, thus mass. This more dense substance, whether water or other liquid, does have an increased mass. This is like a helium balloon when you first fill it up it floats, after time it settles to the floor. I dont mean that this is the same, but it was what I was thinking about. With that the larger mass will be pulled by gravity with greater force. F=ma  I felt we all agreed with this. It was evident in our experimentation whether we used colored ice or any other substance.

108804,1425758922,2,Week 8,"I believe cold water particles move less and more slowly, and because of this take up less space, which makes cold water more dense - I think gravity must have something to do with it as when particles are more dense, gravitational pull is greater, so wouldnt that make them move to the bottom of the glass more rapidly than less dense particles?   It makes sense in what I believe to be true about this.  I dont know what is going on inside the molecules.  I do know it happens, as I wrote about in my response paper to week 7, it occurs in nature - one example is air currents in our atmosphere creating wind currents.  During the day, the land is warmed and the air over it rises allowing the cool air over the ocean to move in and replace the warmer air that is rising from the land - known as a sea breeze, the reverse happens at night - warm ocean air rises and is replaced by the cool air over land creating a land breeze.  Wherever the warmest air is rising, an area of less pressure is created  - less pressure means less gravitational pull, so that would be a part of the whole idea, wouldnt it?
",1
108806,1425760639,2,Week 8,"I just realized I am comparing air currents to water - my intention was to show the similarities of warm air/water rising and being more dense vs. cool air/water sinking due to being more dense.  The less dense, the less pressure, the less gravitational pull - the more dense, the more pressure the more gravitational pull - no matter whether its air or water....

108815,1425830221,3,Week 8,"To answer the questions:  Yes, I think cold things are more dense than warm things.  I also aree that cold water particles more less and more slowly and therefore spread less and collectively take up less space, which makes cold water more dense.  Heres my way of explaining it.  Heat is a form of energy. When molecules have more heat, its the same as saying they have more energy.  With more energy, the molecules move around more and bump into each other more.  When the molecules bump into each other, the molecules with more energy, share their energy with the molecule that has less energy.  The molecules will do this until they all have the same amount of energy (seeking equilibrium).  The more energy the molecules have the more they move around and bump.  All this moving and bumping causes the molecules to be farther apart from one another because they are ricocheting off of each other.  This is why molecules with more heat (more energy) are less dense than cooler (less energy) which have more density.  More energy/heat = more movement/bumping = more space between the molecules = less dense.  Less energy/heat = less movement/bumping = less space between the molecules = more dense.  Watching  convection currents is like watching the pathway that the heat/energy takes as it bumps/moves throughout the molecules in a fluid as it tries to share its energy evenly. 

 

Gravity pulls harder on the cool water because it is more dense.  That means that given x amount of water particles that are cool vs. x amount of water particles that are warm, the warmer water will take up more space (volume) and the cooler water will take up less space (volume).  Density takes into account the amount of particles (in this example they are the same) and how much space those particles are taking up (in this case the cool and warm water particles are taking up different amounts of space).  This difference is their volume is what causes their difference in gravitational pull.  When the same amount of water particles are cooler and all clumped together, gravity is stronger.  When the same amount of water particles are warmer and all spread out, gravity is weaker.  This is why cooler things have more density and will move closer to the source of gravity.
",6
108822,1425842939,4,Week 8,"When thinking about the two different ideas: 1) that currents move the warmer water up from the bottom and bring it closer to the ice cube vs. 2) that warmer water ends up at the top because of density, there is more of a gravitational pull on the cold water because it is more dense than the warm water&hellip;I feel that it is both.

 

The cold water is denser and therefore gravity pulls on it more and displaces the warm water upwards because there is less gravitational pull on this less dense/warm water.  This variation of density and therefore gravitational pull starts the motion of water moving and this also results in the convection currents or moving water in the glass.

So then the question of why cold water is more dense than warm water.   In the prompt the idea that &ldquo;cold water particles move less and more slowly, and therefore spread less and collectively take up less space, which makes cold water more dense&rdquo; was brought up.  This make sense if you think about gravitational pull acting on &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; or sections of water, in cold water the molecules are more tightly packed so in a 1 inch x 1 inch block of water there would be more molecules and therefore the density would be greater than a 1 inch x 1 inch block of hot water.  However, if you think about the mass or density of a molecule of water I do not think that the temperature would matter because the mass of one molecule should be the same regardless of the temperature.  But then this argument states that when water is heated the molecules spread out and are more loosely packed.  How would this work?  Wouldn&rsquo;t that translate into warmer water taking up more space or having a larger volume than cold water?  I don&rsquo;t think this is true.

When looking at the interactive&hellip;the one thing that stands out to me is that when I had the liquid water at like 20 degrees Celsius the molecules hung out wiggling towards the bottom and as I heated it their wiggling increased and ultimately they started moving more.  They spread out by bumping into each other.  It appeared as though as they bumped they gained momentum and the speed at which the collisions occurred resulted in them spreading out even more.  There was more space in between the molecules.  One question I have is what is this &ldquo;space&rdquo; between the molecules?  Does the empty &ldquo;space&rdquo; have mass?  Is it just the molecules that have mass?
",8
108837,1425867457,5,Week 8,"I am generally on board with everything in the consensus.  However, I dont feel that we have given any attention to the gradient or separation between the salt water and the fresh water.  When we forced ice below the surface, the melt times were nearly the same as in fresh water.  Our consensus should include mention of how the salt water interrupted the convection flow.  

I like the question about water acting as a cohesive entity.   Why does sinking water tend to stay together and not disperse more.  We saw how it clumps with the food coloring.  Why does it not diffuse in a downward direction?
",7
108842,1425902219,6,Week 8,"Cold things are more dense than warm things because groups of cold particles are more compact than groups of warm particles. Cold things have less thermal energy than warm things, so their particles are drawn more closely to each other. Gravity pulls on all particles equally, but if you have more cold particles in a given volume, that volume of particles will have a greater density than an equal volume of warmer particles since the warmer particles are more spread out. Because there are more cold particles in an equal volume, there is more matter for gravity to exert its force on, hence the reason why cold things sink and warm things float.

 
",4
108989,1426023512,7,Week 8,,2
108990,1426023848,1,Week 8,"I also agree that the colder particles are closer together because they dont have enough energy to move fast or spread out. So they kind of huddle together, which gives them proximity, to gain energy from other particles. Kind of like cold piglets trying to get warm. Once they are close together they become more efficient at energy transfer which allows them to gain energy to move away from other particles and break free. While they are close together, they have more piglets per unit volume, which makes them more dense, thus falling to the bottom. Once they gain enough energy to break way, they move to the top.  So what happens is the colder particles/piglets, push the warmer, less dense, particles/piglets out of the way. This now sounds like the syringe problem, Lots of pushing.
",2
108994,1426033236,8,Week 8,"The cold water is acting as a cohesive entity penetrating the warm water around it (sort of!).  If we consider that the particles have a limit to how fast they can adjust there position and transfer heat then it is reasonable to consider a snap shot of the system and treat the cold water as a single entity within the warmer water.  The colder water vibrates less and takes up less space per unit area making it more dense.  If gravity is pulling on each particle equally then if you have more particles in a single area then the collective force over a given two dimensional plane (horizontal to the surface of the Earth) then there will be more force pointing downwards over that plane by the denser concentration of particles.  Its kind of like the scales of justice.  If both sides of the scale are the same size and you have an equal height of particles above each scale but more particles fit on one side of the scale then the other then the scale side with more particles is going to feel more force due to gravity then the other and that side will drop down carrying the particles with it.
",9
108996,1426045822,9,Week 8,"Overall I agree with the consensus.  Cold water is more dense than warm water.  Warm water has more energy which causes the particles/molecules to spread apart and take up more space.  the colder waters particles are closer together and more compact, and this makes the water more dense.

 

I dont think this, however addresses our original question about the salts effect on melting ice in water.  I dont think there was a question regarding how the particle arrangement compared in cold water to warmer water.  The original experiment was about the effect of salt on melting ice when mixed in water.  I thought the salt slowed down the convection current, but I dont think we have figured out how this mechanism works in its entirety,  Yes, the salt at the bottom may have made the water more dense, so the cold water did not go to the bottom of the glass, but at some point there was a change or a convection current, as the ice did eventually melt.  At what point does the salt no longer have an effect on the convection current?  Why does the ice at some point begin to melt and the temperature start to reach equilibrium?  How? How does it move from slowing down or stopping the convection flow, to allowing the convection flow?
",5
109054,1426096412,10,Week 8,"When thinking in terms of temperature, molecules move faster when more energy is present and they spread out and take up more space. The inverse happens when less energy is present. Particles with less energy move slowly and are close together, so the temperature does affect the density of water.

The amount of difference in its density is slight. The colder water molecules group together and are could be denser because of its proximity to each other. As particles begin to move towards the warmer particles, the density of the water can change. The particles are spread out and are moving quickly causing the density to change. As the colder particles are being pulled downward, the warmer particles take their place creating this movement (convection currents).

 

Gravitational pull is based on the mass of an object. When thinking about how temperature affects gravity, in order for there to be a difference in gravitational pull, the cold water would have to work as a cohesive entity. The greater the mass the greater the gravitational pull a substance has. The gravitational pull that is being exerted on the water should be the same. The difference would come from the one force pushing on another. I am not convinced about this idea and need to really investigate it further.

109233,1426331096,1,Week 9,"It is so hard to put ourselves back into this time when &ldquo;caloric theory&rdquo; was the dominant paradigm and anything outside of that was the challenge.  We modern thinkers, having been trained in middle school physical science, are very comfortable with the concept of heat as a form of kinetic energy.  The idea of a mysterious fluid that conveys heat, or &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; heat, seems fanciful.

As a side note, Count Rumford (named Thompson earlier in life) was a Colonial military &ldquo;wannabee&rdquo; who was rejected by George Washington as an officer for the Continental Army.  It is a separate story of perseverance that after his rejection from the American Revolution he traveled to England and remade himself into the industrial and scientific contributor that he did.  Lesson: we all have our own talents and sometimes they are not what we thought they were.

Back to &ldquo;caloric&rdquo;, I find it puzzling that the question of how light seems to have heat with it does not factor into the discussion at a much earlier point.

Just as we are learning how to question each other, and listen to what our students find in their sense-making of ideas, the scientific community continues to do this even after a belief is &ldquo;proven&rdquo;.  If scientists took the Caloric Theory and never questioned it, we would all still believe this to be the &ldquo;golden rule&rdquo; of sorts about heat transfer.  So, for me, this opened my eyes a bit to why questioning ideas and what others believe to be true is a good thing.

I found that Sadi Carnot&rsquo;s idea, &ldquo;that just as water flows downhill, caloric flows from hot to cold: and the steam engine utilizes this caloric flow just as a water wheel takes energy from falling water&rdquo;. Made the most sense to me.  I can imagine the hot to cold flow of energy, and bringing gravity into the equation would bring in the piece we were talking about last week.  But why does caloric flow from hot to cold?  I think that&rsquo;s where I was last week in my thinking.  Why is cold denser?  What makes it that way and how can it be explained?

I know that this is one of the ideas that scientists at the time struggled with. Newton&rsquo;s analogy of atoms as soft oranges and caloric as a fluid coating the oranges is easy for me to visualize, but I have trouble following the logic that adding more caloric fluid will cause the oranges to swell in size. Won&rsquo;&rsquo;t adding more fluid simply occupy more space between the oranges?

  
The part of the article that really resonated with me was the description of Rumford&rsquo;s explanation of the relationship between friction and heat. Rumford describes heat resulting from friction as the &ldquo;jiggling atoms causing neighboring atoms to jiggle as they came into contact.&rdquo; In this sense, &ldquo;caloric fluid&rdquo; is used more or less as a term to describe heat flow as the motion of atoms. As such, I find myself gravitating toward the latter half of Joule&rsquo;s idea on the final page of the article where he describes the space between atoms being filled with the &ldquo;oscillations of the atoms themselves&rdquo; rather than caloric fluid. &ldquo;Caloric fluid,&rdquo; at least to me in a literal sense, denotes some type of matter.

109269,1426455402,6,Week 9,"What a great summary!  As I read I was constantly thinking of how these scientists were using their knowledge of common experiences to justify what was happening and how we have been doing the same (not to mention watching elementary age students do the same!)  Back then, they too were using experiences to propose theories and different experiences to try and disprove them.  

I was intrigued by the consistent pursuit of the law of conservation of energy.  It seemed to be at the forefront of many of the discussions and was even brought about by the boring of cannons which could not have a near limitless supply of caloric ether.  So many times this caloric theory proved useful because the scientists seemed to have a grasp of how heat moved, they just didnt understand what heat was.  This leads me to wonder about some theories we have today that are comparable.  For instance, we have theories that help us understand quantum mechanics, but it doesnt work with gravity.  We have the law of gravity, but it too doesnt work at the extremes near the event horizon of a black hole (or at least I dont think it does).  Do we have theories we are working with today that are helping us gain understandings around us but the theories themselves are based incorrectly on the nature of such things like gravity?  Wouldnt it be cool if the people at CERN figured some new ground breaking idea because they were the first to be able to detect something we have never thought of?

The first thing that struck us was the opening statement, &ldquo;I strongly believe that it is not a waste of time to discuss some earlier theories that turned out to be wrong.&rdquo; We both agreed with that statement especially after all of the thinking that has taken place while taking this class. What we thought to be scientifically true has been tested many times and our thought process has changed tremendously because of it. For example we thought we knew the answer to the question about what type of water will the ice melt faster. We assumed we were correct in our thinking that it would melt faster in the cup with salt water.  Science is certainly an area of many unknowns that need to continuously be questioned.

Even after reading and discussing the article together we still are not quite clear or comfortable with what Caloric Theory or Caloric fluid is. We feel as though we do not have enough background knowledge to make sense of what the article is trying to say.  We felt more comfortable with the analogy of the electrical rod and the crate or oranges but still had trouble transferring this to better understand the caloric fluid.  We talked a lot about if the fluid was actually a fluid or they just used this because it made sense to explain how something flows.  For example, when they talk about the caloric or electric fluid it is like the energy is moving from one place to another&hellip;it is flowing.  Is it actually fluid or is it just that the energy is passed from one atom to another and thus it flows like a fluid would.

109250,1426421713,10,Week 9,"After watching the simulation, I think I understand better.  The heat energy passes from molecule to molecule.  More heat energy = more movement (bumping/bouncing) = more space between molecules = more pressure = states of mater moving from solid to liquid to gas.  Less heat energy = less movement (more clumping) = less sapce between molecules = less pressure = states of mater moving from gas to liquid to solid.  So the question is why do they clump and sink with less heat energy?  I say because of gravity.  Every object in the universe has a gravitatinonal pull on every other object.  How strong that gravitational pull is depends on mass and distance of the two objects.  In this case were looking at two water molecules.  With less heat energy, the water molecules are moving and bumping less, therefore closer together.  Being closer together, their gravitational pull on one another is inceased so they clump together.  As two molecules clump together, their collective mass has increased and they collectively have an increased gravitational pull on the other singular molecules near it.  There is also gravitational pull between this collective clump of molecules and the Earth.  As the molecules clump, it also increases the gravitational pull that is between them and the Earth, causing them to sink.  This is how convection currents work. 

            I think that the state changes is a see saw  between gravitational pull between molecules and heat energy being the stronger force giving the molecules engough energy to break the gravitational pull between them and the other water molecules.

            The simulation also had Argon, Oxygen and Neon.  I dont know, but suspect these gases were choosen becuase they are the major components of our atmosphere/air.  Therefore these molecules are also intermingeled between the water molecules more as heat energy is increased, with less heat energy, the types of molecules will seperate more into layers like a density column.  Each type of atom has a different mass, so therefore each type of molecule would have a measurable mass as well.  This different mass would affect the gravitational pull between each molecule of their own type, other types of molecules and their gravitational pull between them and the Earth.  Each type of molecule would also need different amounts of heat to over power the gravitational force between each other object.  That would be why different substance each have the unique characteristic of a melting and boiling point.

109265,1426448233,11,Week 9,"How do convection currents form? In other words, how does gravity pull on the colder water more than the colder water?

For this I think that because the colder water moves less, it is able to stay closer together because it has less heat energy,so it is being pulled by gravity more as a unit.  Which answers the second question, Can water act as a cohesive unit? I think because there is less movement of the particles (as it shows in the second simulation also), it can be considered more &ldquo;unit-like&rdquo; as the particles are still close and there is less space between them allowing for gravity to pull on the molecules on less of an individual basis.  Being closer together, they move in unison and they aren&rsquo;t flying off in different directions as shown in the simulation.  When they are flying off in different directions, gravity has to overcome that movement as well, so they would have different reaction times toward the pull of gravity.  

I am still thinking of the why - why do they stay closer together?  In thinking of the gas particles within the molecule, are they less dense because of the warmth, which would allow them to float up?  Is this where the &ldquo;current&rdquo; comes from?

I enjoyed your write up about particle movement. It lead me to think further about the closeness of colder particles and the greater distance of warmer particles. I was thinking that its almost like survival of the fittest. The colder particles, due to their proximity, are able to steal the energy faster from other particles faster than distant warmer particles. The warmer more spaced out particles dont have as many opportunities to steal energy from other particles. I was wondering if they are not as cohesive as we think. Maybe they are particles of opportunity. The more opportunities they have to steal energy from other particles, the more they gain, and the stronger they get. Survival of the fittest? What do you think? I thought, as I was watching the colder particles, that they forced their way around and collected as much energy as they could so they could break away from the pack. It does appear that they have more gravitational force due to their proximity.

How do convection currents form? In other words, how does gravity pull on the colder water more than the warmer water? When we think about convection currents we think about why the water is moving.  Why does the hot water want to move upwards and the cold water move downwards?  When watching the simulation we saw that when the temperature increases the water molecules moved more quickly, they also spread out.  When the temperature is decreased the water molecules slow down and move closer together.  We believe that although the water molecules are individual molecules, there is some kind of a bond between the cold water molecules that is stronger than the bond between warm water molecules.  This bond, would create a greater mass in the cold water&hellip;therefore there is more gravitational pull on the cold water than the warm water. 

Can water act as a cohesive unit?  Yes, we think so because as we said earlier, there is some kind of bond.  If you have two droplets of water next to each other, don&rsquo;t they want to join together to make a bigger droplet?

If so, as Donna wondered, does that also apply to hot air and cold air? What&rsquo;s happening at the molecular level there?   We believe that in cold air, yes, the molecules are still more tightly packed together however we do not feel that they would join as they would in water.  The bond does not occur.  The molecules are moving faster in the hot air than the cold air.  We are really not sure about this bond and how it occurs.

109521,1426727228,18,Week 9,"So cold water particles are closer together.  I believe gravity pulls more on cold water than it does warm water, but I do believe it is easier to pull on the cold water because the molecules are all together, so it flows as one collective unit.  I think about pudding or jelly and how much easier it is to put that on a spoon compared to soup.  I dont know if this is good analogy, but it is easier to grab the jelly, pudding, or grits:)  When you add heat to the mix, and the particles separate, they have more movement and they move in different ways or directions.

When I think of convection currents and how this occurs, I think about the trading of states and the increase in the movements of the molecules. and when there is less energy the molecules are closer and easy to pull. When they come down they push the other molecules the warmer ones to the top and then they lose energy and the molecules get closer and the gravity pulls on this unit.

Jen your response is well thought through and well supported-  I am having trouble with the gravity concept.   It is not that I don&rsquo;t think there is some attraction between the two, (I make it a practice not to argue with Newton or Einstein).  What I am having trouble with is how the gravitational attraction between the particles is overcoming the force of gravity toward the planet? 

Why are not the particles that are losing energy not just simply &ldquo;sinking&rdquo; to the bottom of the fluid?  In the model they seem to somewhat sink but in actuality we don&rsquo;t get a pile of slower molecules around our feet from the gases that have cooled.  What is keeping this space between particles open?

Greg, I am with you on the inaccuracy of the model.  Your citations of our experiences in observation are in support of that.  I think we both need to keep in perspective that the model is not presented as a convection model.  It is simply presented as a basic particle motion model between states of matter and different polar and non-polar molecules.  The mechanism of convection is clearly much more complicated than can be shown by the hundred or so particles in the cartoon. 

Also, as you point out, we understand the same principles to work in gases and we needn&rsquo;t look any further than the unit that we just did on &ldquo;wind &amp;amp; currents&rdquo; in support of this.  There is something else making particles work cohesively, en masse, and I don&rsquo;t think it is gravity.  It has something to do with particles of similar energy levels having a tendency to not cross the interface to another level (higher or lower).

A more advanced model might allow the viewer to zoom in and out,  from a macro view of the fluid, many thousands of times down to the particles and it would also allow the viewer to pan across the container to look at different sections, also at different &ldquo;zooms&rdquo;.

The current seems to just haphazardly flow downward, as does the warm in the opposite direction (upward).  So, I still have questions as to why.  Other than the fact that we KNOW it happens, I am still grappling with the reason behind it.  I keep going back to the gas particles within the water molecule - when that part of a molecule is heated - could this be a reason behind the movement upward?

I appreciate the analogy of the concertgoers.  I have really been struggling with how to unpack what is happening in this scenario at the molecular level.  I can see that there is convection currents but when I try to explain it, my explanation seems to work when thinking about the water as a cohesive unit but falls apart when looking at individual molecules.

So, you refer the molecule moving away from the stage near the margin whereas when it moves back towards the stage it goes right down the center.  That is very interesting.  I keep watching it but am having trouble following certain molecules and seeing any consistency in how they move.  I mean, I see them speeding up and slowing down and moving around but do not see any connection between moving up in the outside of the cup and moving down in the center of the cup.  Do you think we would see the same thing in a liquid experiments&hellip;the convection currents between the hot and cold liquids would have the hot liquid moving up on the exterior of the cup and down in the center of the cup?  I would imagine it to be the other way around, especially if the heat source is in the center of the cup.  The water would be heated and move up from the center.

I am with you that the water molecules at the bottom of the container move around more and bump into each other more violently which in turn results in them spreading out.  One question I have is in reference to the increased gravitational pull on the cold molecules.  I have been struggling with this.  I get that the molecules are more tightly packed when they are cold&hellip;but to say that there is more gravitational pull on them collectively confuses me.  I feel that the gravitational pull would be on the individual molecules, so how does gravity pull &ldquo;collectively&rdquo; on the cold water molecules together?

109978,1427158341,16,Week 9,"Hi Karen and Katie,

At our last meeting I thought very much along the same lines as youve described in terms of cold water molecules being drawn together more tightly than warm molecules, and I think youve done a very nice job articulating that in your response. The result, as youve stated, is that there is greater gravitational pull on the tightly-packed group of cold water molecules since there is more matter in a given volume. 

After thinking more about this based on some comments from Vesal and after going through the simulation again, Im second-guessing myself&hellip; Assuming the simulation is an accurate representation of what happens to water molecules at various temperatures, I didnt really notice much difference in space between the colder molecules toward the top of the container and the warmer molecules closer to the heat source. Im beginning to think that heat energizes the molecules closest to the heat source, causing them to push upward into the molecules above them. Because there are so many molecules above them being pulled down by gravity, the warmer molecules have a difficult time pushing their way to the top. Once they are heated to the point where there is enough energy to allow them to temporarily overcome gravity and push with enough force to displace the molecules above them, they will work their way toward the surface while the colder molecules at the surface are moved out of the way and pulled downward by gravity.

I have no idea if this is even remotely accurate or if Ive simply allowed another possible explanation to infiltrate my brain in order to confuse me more!

109979,1427158681,12,Week 9,"Hi Katie,

I totally agree, I dont think it makes much sense that the warm molecules would gravitate toward the outer margins of the container while the cold remains more toward the center given the location of the heat source. I wouldnt expect to see this in a liquid. I think I went at least temporarily cross-eyed while trying to keep track of the single molecule that I focused in on... Im thinking that despite what occurred with the one molecule that I observed, it is exactly that: an observation of the behavior of only one molecule that I sort of drew a larger conclusion on. Thinking more about this now I wouldnt be surprised if this molecule represented an exception rather than the norm. It was interesting watching this one molecule try to work its way up the center and then get sort of bounced out of the way and off to the margins though. Definitely not what I expected.

110573,1427220134,20,Week 9,"Responses to three arguments above:

1. Agreed. Some of the outermost particles bail out of the descending cold current as they gain energy from all of the bumping they experience from the warmer particles around them. Nevertheless, there are enough cold particles descending that this does not stop the current.

2. Possibly, but I still think the thumping/bumping of the surrounding warm molecules into the column of cold molecules will cause some of the cold molecules to warm up and leave the descending column of cold molecules.

 

3. Not so sure about this any more, even though I initially supported it. Gravity will pull on all particles equally. I think the upward push of the molecules closest to the heat source pushes up on the cold molecules above them. The energized molecules close to the heat source temporarily overcome gravity and push upward, causing the cold molecules above them to move upward as well. Although the cold molecules are pushed up, they come back down due to the pull of gravity.

I agree with your thinking that the colder water molecules move less and are more tightly packed. I am still unsure about the gravitational pull needed to pull them down towards the bottom. I also believe that they do act as a cohesive unit as they move closer together. When I read the part about there is less space it made me start thinking about how the lack of space contributes to the gravitational pull. One thing Katie and I struggled with was how is the gravitational pull really that different. I believe the consensus is the cold water molecules are now some sort of unit while still keeping their individuality. If this is the case wouldnt the gravitational pull still be the same.

I kind of like the crowd analogy.  water molecules with more energy (the person on the move) will find the open space more so than the person (water molecule) with less energy and as that particle randomly propagates to the area of lower concentration it bumps other crowd members (water molecules) and gives them the some energy (or tendency to want to go to open spaces due to their energy).

In your second paragraph I too struggle with the idea of the rate at which the system goes to equilibrium due to the diffusion of thermal energy.  Not that I have a firm grasp on it...but I just consider that is exactly what kills a convection current which is why a convection current needs a source that causes the thermal equilibrium to be off...in the case of chefs everywhere...a gas burner.  So I think you are explaining some of the mechanism for sure because the system does continually try to go to equilibrium.  You are also directly addressing the first topic to be discussed that was suggested by the instructors.

The second comment they make goes against what you were talking about.  That the warm water corrals the cold...you said it...there is no membrane keeping the cold and warm apart and there is certainly interaction...just look how quickly a pot of water stops its rolling boil after you turn the heat off.

Per our instruction, I am going to address the third topic.  The gravity between the particles.  Id like to see the gravity between the particles calculated with such small masses (lowering the strength) and such close distances (increasing the strength)...but Id have to guess it is negligible when compared to the forces between the particles causes by thermal energy differences.

I was picturing the corralling of the cold water but not due to the motion of the cold particles vs. that of the warmer particles.  The cold and warm particles are definitely interacting all over and there is no one barrier that acts as a sort of line of demarcation.  I was thinking at first that there was an area where there was the greatest change between cold and warm kind of marking a fuzzy barrier but not Im not so sure.  What ever exchanges there are between the molecules it causes the behavior due to temperature differences are governed by the same laws (phenomena) between any two particles and that is what is causing the convection...that and a continual heat source.

Im not sure about the particle gravity idea....I cant see the masses being enough despite their close proximity.

My only question here would be how could water at 0 degrees C not be frozen.  My second choice (not sure if I should give one, but I was really torn) would be in the cooler with ice and room temp water as the warm cans of soda would melt some of the ice then the water would surround the cans and as I stated above, by surrounding the cans, would cool the soda as they would be surrounded by the cold completely.  My question here would be - would the ice melt so fast with room temp water that it wouldn&rsquo;t be cold enough to cool the water to a point where one would want it to be quickly enough before equilibrium was reached between the soda and water.  
I think, in both cases, the container is smaller than a refrigerator, so the soda would cool faster with the coldness locked into the smaller place that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t choose a fridge.

First when thinking about this questions we felt that having the water in the tub would be beneficial as opposed to just air.  This is because the water would surround the can and with more surface of the can in contact with the water it would cool faster than simply ice cubes because there would be pockets of air (the air temp would be warmer) between the ice cubes.  When deciding between the 0 degree water and the ice with room temperature water we started considering what would happen in each scenario.  Our first inclination was that the 0 degree tub would cool the cans faster because even if you add ice to room temperature water it would not be colder than 0 degrees, it would be warmer.  However, after thinking about our previous experiment with convection currents we have revised our thinking.  We think that the tub with room temperature water and ice cubes would cool the soda the fastest.  We know that soda cans sink in water, they would be sitting at the bottom of the tub.  When we added the ice to the room temperature water they would float and cool the water around them at the surface of the water.  As this water cools (and the ice cubes start to melt the cool water would be pulled towards the bottom of the tub (where the cans are located) and cool them down.  As this cold water off cools the soda, the ice melt off would be warmed because it is in contact with the warm cans and then it would rise (because warm water molecules rise) and then the newly created cold molecules (from the ice melt) would replace them.  This would be a continual cycle until the soda cans cool down to the same temperature as the water around them.

110998,1427749500,6,Week 11,"Based on my past experience trying to cool warm ahem&hellip;sodas&hellip; quickly, I say put the cans in a cooler filled with ice and pour COLD tap water over the ice! Since thats not an option, Ill say simply fill the cooler with 0C degree water. At this temperature, water is at the brink of its freezing point, and since it is in a liquid form, the cold water molecules will make contact with more of the cans surface area than ice cubes will (too many gaps of air between each ice cube). 

A cooler of ice with room temperature water poured over it may keep the cans cooler for a longer period of time as the temperature of the ice is below 0C degrees, but the ice will likely have to absorb a considerable amount of thermal energy from the surrounding water, as well as from the cans, which I think will take a longer duration of time than simply putting the cans in 0C degree water.

For instance...is the ice densely packed so less than half the cooler is empty space to be filled with room temperature water?  If so, then I say bury it in ice and poor the room temperature water over it.  If the ice is 0 degrees F and the water is 70 degrees F then the two would definitely average out below the freezing point of water with the energy needed to melt the ice keeping it well below the half way point of 35 degrees F (meaning its how we get our ice water bath... lots of contact between the can and densely packed colder water molecules offering the most heat transfer out of the can...more colder particles sucking heat from warm soda cans)

So the same amount of particles that hit the outer can will transfer their energy outside. The particles that are in the middle have to fight to get to the outside to transfer their energy. But at the same time they are transferring their energy to the particles that are now lower in temp.. On going bumping and transferring of energy. So if the surface of the can on the outside is totally in contact with the cold, water and ice, then it makes sense that more energy can be transferred out.

I also was told not to put hot dishes in the fridge because it makes the fridge work overtime to reduce the inside temperature. The hot dishes transfer their energy to the inside of the fridge, making everything else warm. Then the fridge has to work hard to cool down the inside of the fridge.

Yes, I think it gives great support to the idea that closer, denser particles will absorb more thermal energy.  But just to correct your understanding of what I did, the Sams were placed in the freezer, which is significantly colder than an ice cube that is left in an open container  (freezer around 10F and ice cube exposed to ambient temps for more than a few minutes would be at 30-32F.

Regarding the solid ice response to temperature: What I am not communicating clearly, is that it seems to me, ice is much more responsive to temperature change.  In other words it takes ice cannot absorb very much thermal energy before it starts to show a change in temperature as opposed to liquid water which will absorb tremendous amounts of energy before responding with a temperature change.

I see it more along the lines of the bumper cars that transfer kinetic energy from faster to slower cars in a collision.  The slow bumper car did not seek out the faster collision.  On your comment about temperature differential I am wondering how much more limited gas is in transferring that energy compared to a convecting liquid.  Here is a question that models this dilemma:  How would it compare if you step out of doors on a 0F morning, with low humidity and no wind compared to stepping into a pool of water at 35F?   The water would be much more uncomfortable.   In other words, the convection of the gas molecules against one&rsquo;s skin would have a much less effect compared to the instant cooling of the water.    Of course, as you mentioned, a closed freezer with a moving air source would be a different story.

And the more densely positioned particles in a liquid will affect that transfer even faster because they are colliding faster.

Your diagram is clarifying for all of our discussions around a liquid.  I noticed that you did not include gases in this model.   How do you think it would differ?   While the gases certainly would form convection currents, I am wondering how organized that convection could become and if it would have any additional cooling power by bringing colder gases down.  Of course then there is the buoyancy of ice that we have to consider.  This buoyancy, which does not exist in a gaseous situation.  In a gas, the natural flow of convection would be driven by the warmer gas rising and not by the more dense gas particles sinking (unless there were colder plates or fins that were positioned above the sample in the spot where the ice cubes are floating).

I think we have to determine to separate the liquid discussion from the gas discussions.  It seems that most of us agree, for now that liquid/ice  is the more effective path.

I enjoyed reading your paper but I disagree with some ideas. First, I dont agree with equal absorption of heat by water and air. If there is more space between air particles than water particles, then doesnt it make sense that air can hold more heat/energy than water? You mentioned that there is more space between air particles than water particles and that this distance determines the speed of heat transfer. I agree with this and I think we all do. So doesnt it make sense that this same space can fill up with more energy?

I took another class years go, it was a weather class, and in this class we super cooled water to below freezing point. It was still liquid, until we added ice to heat it up then it solidified. It was totally cool. Anyway, we did this experiment to show that water can be cooled to below freezing and still be liquid. This happens all the time with weather in the clouds. The water is super cooled and remains liquid. Anyway, why cant this apply to ice? What I mean is, you said that ice can be colder than freezing and what I am proposing, is the same for liquid water.

One more idea is on the sucking idea. I think we all agree that ice doesnt suck heat/energy, but the energy is passed from one substance from higher energy particles to lower energy particles. Agree:)

I am also intrigued by your ice experiment with the frozen probe.  I had agreed, with out empirical evidence, that the ice could get colder than 32 degrees.  Now, youve shown it can get much colder.  What is interesting is that the warmer the ice was, the more quickly it seemed to take on heat.  The colder the ice cube was, the slower it took on the heat.  I wonder was the heat transfer working at the same rate both times, but it took more heat energy to move the molecules closer to the enclosed probe in 9F example?  Or does heat transfer happen more quickly or slowly depending on the differing temperatures between the substances?  My gut instinct wants to say that the rate of heat transfer depends on the delta between the two substance.  However, my logical side wants to say that it happens at a constant rate.  Im not sure to be honest.

I sounds like youre saying heat transfer happens more quickly if there is a greater delta in temperature between the substances.  Do you think heat travels more quickly between two objects with a wide range in their temperature?  OR  Do you think that the cooler substance has more room to take on more heat that a substance closer in temperature to the soda can so it can cool it down more?  I was unsure which you meant from your explanation after the soda experiment. 

 

I think you also explained how water can be 0 degrees C and still be water and not ice.  Did I understand that right?

I was captivated by your paper right away after reading your perspective of how heat moves in that the heat is &lt;em&gt;transferred&lt;/em&gt; from the soda to the water/air rather than the water/air &lt;em&gt;absorbing&lt;/em&gt; heat from the soda. Im not entirely sure why Ive always believed that cold particles essentially absorb heat, but for some reason I always have, despite the fact that we typically refer to it as &ldquo;heat transfer,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;heat absorption!&rdquo;

I also found your ideas about specific heat fascinating. It makes sense to me that large bodies of water do not freeze entirely due to how much energy water can absorb, and that air seems to have a much greater capacity to absorb heat. This, combined with the feedback you left for my paper, leave me questioning my idea that water and air transfer energy equally, just at different rates.

I just read and responded to Deannas paper, and I think I am officially abandoning my prior understanding of heat transfer as being an absorption of heat by a colder object/substance! I think you do a good job providing rationale for that when you describe heat as the product of a whole lot of particles pushing/bumping together as we determined in our prior investigation.

Very good point about the additional particles that will exist in ice when compared to water, and that those additional particles may provide more opportunity for other warmer particles to bump into them and transfer heat. I agree that there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; variables in terms of some soda cans being more in contact with air/water/ice than others, but in general, it seems to make sense that ice will cool the sodas faster.

112881,1428933832,9,Week 12,"Greg-

I think I understand you to say that the density of molecules is the driving force behind heat transfer. Which makes sense, the closer the molecules are to each other the faster the transfer of energy occurs, due to contact. the contact between molecules in a liquid and gaseous state are due to incidental contact.You stated that molecules that move too fast can not lock together, which seems to make sense as well. The structure of water in crystalline pattern provides stability and more efficient transfer of energy from particle to particle. The experiment with the ice and ice water bath proved that the ice alone transfers the energy at a faster rate than the ice water bath. This is due to the close proximity of the water molecules. 
",10
112894,1428936149,7,Week 12,"Jenn-

I share some of your same thoughts. The more particles, the more contact hey have with each other as mentioned in a solid. The transfer of energy occurs at a faster rate because of their close proximity to each other. There is more opportunity for bumping to occur for that same reason. As the particles transfer, the closeness allows the passing of energy to happen. 

It is true that the air at room temperature and the ice can create movement at different rates depending on the which part of the surface of the can is being exposed by a particular temperature. Some cans could be completely submerged in ice, where others could be partially submerged and another part exposed to room temperature air. If there are multiple cans than you could also think about the possibility of one can touching another as a factor as well. Many of these scenarios would influence how particles move.

I am so sorry about the confusion.  The second bath was the ice water as it got room temp water poured into it.  I really dropped the ball by not mentioning in my two pieces of data collected that they were temps taken from inside the can right after they were pulled out after 5 minutes.  All the ice started at 9 degrees.  And yes! I definitely should have taken the temp of the ice water bath (I assume it was 32 degrees...but that is just an assumption.

As for the last comment.  Yes, I think water and ice can coexist indefinitely in closed system with minimum if not no heat transfer at all.  I think if there is just the right amount of molecular energy and pressure you could have liquid and solid water just teetering on the brink of the freezing point...but I am also now assuming that there is something about the polarity of water that would play a role in water being a solid or a liquid that I am not thinking of.

Thanks for the feedback (and thanks to the others as well!).  Your comments got me thinking about heat transfer through solids other than ice.  We know metals are good conductors when they are solid but other solids are not good conductors when solid (ceramics I think)...so...what is it about the different solids that allows for the greater conductivity of heat?...Im thinking its the type of bonds they have.  Metals share electrons and These can speedily transfer energy as the electrons move and not the nuclei....other solids are poor conductors (Im guessing because the molecules dont have anything moving...whereas liquids do...hmmmm.)  Are these other materials better at transferring heat then their solid states because of convection?
",9
113045,1429053083,1,Week 12,"Hi Kathy,

I think the air cools more than the water due to the density of the air vs. the density of the water.  I think pressure has something to do with it - high pressure vs. low pressure - depending on what example is being described.  At night, the pressure over water is not as great as warm air above the water rises (warmed by the ocean water), pressure on land is greater due to the cooler air sinking - so again it kind of goes back to a convection current of sorts, I think.

I thought the questions referred to the relationship of water and air.  Meaning does water draw more warmth from the soda or does air draw more warmth.

You state water draws more warmth than air because of proximity.  We agree on this:)  The closer the contact the greater the ability to share energy.  What do you mean when you say ice determines how much  of a draw occurs?

Katy and Karen- we are in agreement about sucking not capturing how the energy is transferred. It is more of a pushing and colliding of particles.  I picture them bumping around and sharing energy. We also agree about the surface area and how proximity/contact plays a role in the transfer.  

I agree that a freezer will cool something faster than the refrigerator.  I say it is because of the drastic difference in temperature.  It seems you two are saying the same.  Why is my question?  I know this based on personal experience, but now I wan to know the mechanism behind it.

Hi Chris,

Its always interesting to read what youve wrote. I find myself questioning the topic more and thinking about different scenarios. In regards to your response to the behavior of air, water, and ice with respect to heat transfer I am not totally convince with your explanation. I dont think that the water and air that are cooled to the same temperature will draw an equal amount of warmth from the soda. I agree that the water molecules in a liquid state are closer together and therefore will draw more warmth away from the can as opposed to the air molecules that are more spread out. I like how you said the air molecules will bounce off of the can, this makes sense because now less air molecules are drawing warmth away from the can. I also agree with the constant contact of the liquid molecules surrounding the can, this was one of the scenarios that Katie and I used to answer one of the questions.

I also found it beneficial when you brought this back to our ice cube experiments with the ice from the ice cube tray verses crushed ice.
",12
113153,1429147666,2,Week 12,"Becky,

I certainly agree with your thoughts on how the amount of contact facilitates a greater amount of heat transfer. One thing I found very interesting was how you described what could be happening inside the can. I think what you are describing  is its almost as if there is a chain reaction or like bumper cars that is taking place with the particles in the can bumping into the particles of the actual can and then continue to air particles.

113155,1429148663,3,Week 12,"Hi Deanna,

Your ideas about specific heat made me think of a few things.  A hot summer day was the first thing...sounds nice right?  Anyways, on a hot summer day the air gets really warm, warmer than even a kiddie pool would get.  this makes me think water takes longer to heat up than air (because of a high specific heat).  I also thought of double pained windows.  Windows have air in them because air is a good insulator...is air a good insulator because it transfers heat slowly because there are fewer molecules to transfer heat in a gas rather than just a solid window, or is it something else?

As far as supercooled waters ability to suck heat faster I agree, this is crying out for an experiment.

I agree that the closer particles will do more transferring of heat.  I also agree with your reasoning on waters powerful ability to change Earths surface...wind alone doesnt come close to what water does.  there is just simply way more matter in an a volume of water than that of air...more molecules to do more!

thanks for the read!  You are right, in general, we need to stop thinking of cold sucking heat...after all...there is no such thing as cold...its just the absence of heat!  I also liked your hiker evidence you mentioned.  The skin transfers heat  quicker to more skin rather than to air...I also think this is so both people are back into one coat so they are sharing one insulating layer wrapped around two heat sources.

114636,1429875179,5,Week 14,"Hi Becky ~ In your paper you stated, &ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The cooler the temperature the closer the particles move towards each other and when the temperature increases the particles spread farther apart. This distance from particle to particle dictates how quickly energy is transferred.&rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Why do you think the particles move closer together when they cool (I agree with you, but can&rsquo;t get to the why of it)?  You also said, &ldquo;&lt;em&gt;If the particles are farther apart in the air (a gas) than that of water (a liquid), then it should take longer for the air to cool than the water. The distance between particles and the opportunity for contact of particles needs to be considered. Both of these factors affect the transfer of energy.&rdquo;  &lt;/em&gt;This makes a lot of sense to me.  When the movement takes place the particles&rsquo; distance apart determines the amount of contact - the greater the distance, the longer it takes.  

 

I also agree with your idea of energy within a substance.  The you stated, &ldquo;&lt;em&gt;If there is the presence of a large amount of energy then the substance will begin to change its state. The energy creates movement within the bonds and causes the particles to increase their movement. Eventually this movement, if increased enough can potentially create a change in state of matter of a substance.&rdquo;  &lt;/em&gt;This confused me a little because I was wondering if the substance could do this by itself or were you referring to if energy was being added to the substance.  

  
And lastly, I am completely on board with the soda cooling faster in cold water (ice bath) for the same reasons you stated.  You put into words that I couldn&rsquo;t seem to come up with what I was thinking!  
",1
114662,1429897490,6,Week 14,"Chris-

I am curious about this idea of holding energy. I find kinda mysterious. How does it hold on to it? Is it in the bonds or is it simply held by particles moving?? In any case I agree with the idea that ice in water will cool soda more quickly than ice alone. In some ways I think of the liquid water being in some ways like a catalyst that speeds up the transfer of energy.

I also agree with the idea that cooling down is a substance losing energy and a substance that heats up is gaining energy. As that occurs the bumping of particles increase with the gaining of energy and slow down when a substance is losing energy. We are in agreement that air does not cool and warm faster than water. I Something to consider is the distance that these particles have from each other in their current state. How does this affect the bumping that occurs? Perhaps this helps explain and support our idea.

Great question. Do substances stay the same temperature with their surroundings by evenly absorbing and reemitting energy at equal rate and there is some sense of &ldquo;holding&rdquo; onto the energy it has? I had to take some time to think about this and I agree that there has to be some equality between absorbing and giving off energy. I also agree that particles with greater density, the greater the amount of energy that is able to be transferred. The particles are the vehicles that allow this to occur, the more particles, the more movement.I appreciate your experiment, because they were helpful in supporting your ideas.

&lt;em&gt;I don&rsquo;t have any issue with your description of how energy transfers.  I would like to use this chance to narrow down what our collective focus is. At the end of your first section you wrote, &ldquo;If the particles are farther apart in the air (a gas) than that of water (a liquid), then it should take longer for the air to cool than the water.&rdquo;   To me this is the fundamental breakdown in this discussion.  Your sentence describes the warming and cooling of the air or water (as many of our statements over the past month have done).  My understanding of the original question was asking what method for cooling down a can of soda would be most effective (quickest).    As I look at our CF posts we, as a group, seem to be talking about different situations in the same conversation and it has spawned the inconsistencies that we are reading now.  &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;You mentioned in your second part that energy moves through a substance as opposed to being held.  Would not you consider a thermos bottle an example of &ldquo;held&rdquo; or stored energy?  &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Either way, at the end of your write-up we are both in agreement that the ice water bath is going to be most effective.&lt;/em&gt;

114667,1429902980,1,Week 14,"Donnna,

You wondered openly in your first section whether some other mechanism is taking place and I think there is.  Some of the points that have not had too much play in this recent community forum question is the roll of mass of the object and the flow rate of the fluids around it.  By mass I mean total mass, in other words, thermal energy.  We can all see in our minds&rsquo; lab that a teaspoon of water will absorb far less energy than a gallon of water.    You and many of us have used the term density during these forums but density does not quite address the total available energy for absorbing heat from our proverbial soda can.  On top of this a gallon of water can &ldquo;flow&rdquo; which gives it more ability to spread that heat absorbing ability.  As you point out this same phenomenon exists in gases as you describe the land and sea breeze response of our atmosphere near cooler water.  I still wonder what the result would be if we passed large volumes of cold air across the soda can versus  water &amp;amp; ice at the same temperature that was not flowing?  It would be hard to test at home .
",7
114675,1430054712,4,Week 14,"Ultimately, we agree that water with ice is the best way to cool down the soda cans in our scenario, but I think we have different ideas as to why.  Your quote Liquid water will hold its average particle temperature longer and therefore be able to move more energy out of a warm beer can than colder ice &lt;u&gt;because of its ability to flow&lt;/u&gt; has me a little confused.  If liquid water holds its average particle temp longer, wouldnt that make it a good insulator, and therefore not do a good/fast job of moving the heat out of the cans?  Also, I wanted to check and see, are you saying that convection because of its ability to flow is a faster form of heat transfer that conduction?  I hadnt thought about one type of heat transfer working more quickly than another, but now youve got me wondering.  I also really appreciated your thought experiment because it helped me to visualize what you were thinking about.

I will also note that your thought experiment created a unique visual! The only thing Im still not convinced of yet is the idea that water can hold more heat energy that air or ice.  If this was true, then when the launching question experiment had run its course, the water would be left as the warmest thing because it would be holding more heat energy.  However, I think that eventually all three (soda, water, and ice that will melt) will equalize in temperature, which is also saying they will equalize in amounts of heat energy.  I could maybe play with the idea that a solid, liquid, or gas might transfer heat more quickly or slowly than another state, but I dont think one can hold more heat energy than another.

I agree with your description about what it means to cool something down or warm it up. I appreciate the tie-in you made to density and I think you did a very nice job explaining this in terms that are easy to understand. I also like the rephrasing of the consensus idea that you propose due to the odd behavior of water. I think that the idea that more particles that are available to interact with each other creates more opportunities for heat transfer provides a good overall summary.

I found your ideas about water holding more energy than air or ice to be very thought-provoking. I agreed with the idea that water can more or less store more energy than air or ice as evidenced by the fact that, aside from the top couple of feet, a lake will remain liquid water during winter despite the air outside being much colder. To me this suggests that liquid water has the ability to retain more energy than air or ice.

Im with you on the best method to rapidly cool the cans of soda. I originally thought that 0 degree water would be the most effective, but Ive since jumped to the ice and water combination for the very reasons that you mention in your paper.

I agree with your description of what it means to cool something down or warm it up and I like your description of why water heats/cools faster than air being similar to a domino effect of energy transfer given the tightly-packed nature of the water particles compared to air.

I find the water holding more energy than air or ice idea to be very interesting. I think you provide a very good mechanism explaining why this might be the case. If all of those tightly-packed molecules of water contain a certain amount of energy in the form of heat, I think it makes sense that it will take longer for all of those molecules to lose that energy when compared to a substance with fewer particles per a given volume like air.

I agree with you about a combination of ice and water being the most effective way to rapidly cool the cans of soda. I originally thought that 0 degree water alone might result in more rapid cooling, but I agree that the ice is necessary in order to keep the water cool as heat is transferred from the cans of soda.

I am not sure, as you are not sure, about if and how bonds might be involved in the behavior of energy in water/ice. Maybe you are right in thinking that this might lead us to an answer to the cold soda question. I really need to think about this now.

I too agree with your points and thanks for helping me see a few points better such as energy is converted to speed of molecules, molecules bump more when moving more when hot, and all of us experiencing air heating up and cooling down faster....contrary to some ideas we are working with.

You have a few ideas that all work really well together that I am seeing as grounds for answering our question i.e. the density of the molecules are a factor because more molecules hold more energy and the tighter packed molecules transfer heat more often.

It is interesting to think about how we feel air cool off faster and how it takes water longer to warm up and cool down a pool, but that is thinking about the temperature of the water...not its ability to take or give heat to a substance exchanging heat with it....which is where the whole denser materials can have more heat (or a larger deficit of heat) comes into play.

This makes me keep thinking an idea I have been struggling with....is there a high enough temperature of water vapor molecules that they would have more energy per unit volume than liquid water of the same volume? (meaning overcome the lack of density of the air with extreme temperature) and would that water vapor transfer heat more quickly than the much cooler water?

 

 

 I also liked the description of the faster domino effect for molecules transferring energy in water due to closer spacing.

114803,1430175891,1,Week 14,"Donna,

I agree that the bumping of particles is the mechanism (been thinking a lot about that myself).  I also think air cools faster than water (the whole sea/land breeze thing) but I dont think it is quite asking the write question.  the question asks about somethings ability to warm or cool down itself, but we should be asking about somethings ability to cool or warm something else which is answered by your statement Because the water is more dense, its molecules have the ability to bump into the sides of the soda can more often than air.

In regards to the question Does it mean that its capable of keeping the heat energy within the molecules because the molecules stay closer to each other?, I would say yes and no...I like going back to the crowd analogy...it takes longer to empty out a crowded train station than one that has a thinner more dispersed crowd....with people being units of energy.

You said To cool something is to take away heat energy from a substance and you said you need to surround the soda with a substance that has less energy than it in order to draw the heat out of the soda. I am not sure I understand what you are thinking. Are you suggesting that energy gets pulled out? To me, Im not sure, I understand this. I do understand that energy moves from substances with higher temperatures to substances with lower temperatures. I was thinking it is more like pushing along a path, like when you introduce two substances with different temperatures together it kind of creates a path for energy to follow. When the substances are the same temperature, then you have equilibrium. The path is closed and transfer stops.

About the soda. I originally thought that ice and liquid water would be the best choice, Ive been doing this for years. I thought this for the same reasons you do. The particles In water are closer together and allow for faster transmission of energy. Then I thought again. That air particles have more energy than liquid water. So why wouldnt air and ice be the better choice. After all air particles move faster with a lot more energy and can transfer energy much quicker. Now, I really dont know. Im thinking, as long as the soda gets cold.

I think theres a good argument either way. What do you think?

114814,1430223962,3,Week 14,"Jenn,

 

I liked how you referred to the size of the bump as related to the amount of energy and how the bumped molecule would rebound and spread out as a result of the size of the bump.  I understand how you say that the more spread out the molecules the slower the heat transfer would be so air would take longer to heat/up and cool down than water&hellip;I just can not think of a real life experiment that air would take longer than water to heat and/or cool.

I agree that air is a gas and therefore the particles hold more energy in a gas than they do in a liquid&hellip;but do you think the number of particles in a given space plays any role in this?  For example, solid/liquid has particles more tightly packed and therefore these particles may hold more energy in a given amount of space than the same space in a gas?  What do you think?

I agree that the mass plays a role.  Karen and I were talking about the amount of molecules per volume which is essentially the same thing.  It would take longer to heat more molecules in the &ldquo;block&rdquo; of water than the few molecules in the same volume of air.

When you say that ice will change the quickest&hellip;&rdquo;I suspect this because the particle in the ice will conduct the energy from particle to particle more quickly&rdquo;, do you thin this because the particles are more closely packed&hellip;the energy can get passed from molecule to molecule faster because they are closer and there is less &ldquo;lag time&rdquo;?

I agree with how something cools down or warms up. There has to be some type of energy transfer between the molecules, but, what I am curious about is when you described the cooler particles are not moving around as much that it leaves them vulnerable and have no defense for the bumping. I wasnt really clear on what you meant. Originally Katie and I wanted to believe that air cools/warms faster because there must be more energy/bumping and there are less molecules to heat up/cool down. After much debate Im not sure if that holds true. In water the molecules are more closely packed together. This creates more opportunities for bumping. Again, Im not quite sure anymore.

Thank you for this paper.  I appreciated the way you actually provided detail about the atomic structure of ice.  We often talk about particles being closer together in solids, but you are saying that ice is an exception.  This is one concept that students, and adults cannot grasp. To think of ice having particles further apart than water, but yet we are saying the higher the temperature the further the particles.  If ice has a lower temperature, how can the particles be further apart?
