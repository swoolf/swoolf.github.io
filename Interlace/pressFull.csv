79933,1409693918,1,1,Fall: Week 1,...is less and less air pressure pushing inwards on the balloon...,"I dont think balloons go up forever.  As the balloon rises the air becomes less and less dense.  This will cause the balloon to rise at a slower and slower rate until the balloon reaches an equal air density between inside and outside the balloon.  But there is another factor Im not sure about.  Although the helium balloon is a lot less dense than regular air at the surface because of the tiny helium molecules inside the balloon verses that of regular air, there are still a lot of molecules inside that are actively moving about and taking up as much space as the balloon allows.  Well....as the balloon rises there is less and less air pressure pushing inwards on the balloon causing the relatively high number of helium atoms per unit volume inside the balloon.  Will the reduced pressure outside of the balloon cause the heliums pressure inside the balloon to cause it to expand until it pops?

After spending a lot of time practicing in our large group discussions, The more we talked as a class the deeper the ideas went. I was much more at ease with the feeling of restless thought. We got to experience what our students experience quite often. As the school year began, My students take a pretest which covers all of the material that they will learn this year. I have already had students come to me with questions that they are perplexed by. My reaction is much different and now I let them just tell me their thoughts. I know that before I would definitely push them in a particular direction to the correct response, but now I think it is okay for them to be where they are at. We will talk more about these ideas during the school year and letting them rest where they are is okay for now.

81172,1409971456,3,0,Fall: Week 1,,"I will take charge of this experiment.  In the mean time I think I can prove it with words:

We agree that a full helium balloon and string will be buoyant in air because the equivalent volume of air surrounding the total balloon (string and all).  Incrementally, the balloon looses buoyancy as gas leaks out and eventually becomes negatively buoyant and sinks until some part hits the floor.    Since this has been an incremental change, and it has only just begun to sink, the negative buoyancy is very slight.   Once the string hits the floor we can subtract the mass of the portion of string that is resting on the floor from the mass of the rest of the balloon system and thus changing the density to a lower value.  Since the balloon was only very slightly negatively buoyant, the new value is slightly positive and the balloon will rise again until the difference in string mass brings the balloon to the neutral buoyancy and it comes to a stop.    

If one was to cut the string at any point above the floor the balloon will once again rise.  If one was to just pick the string up and coil it together above the floor, then the balloon would continue to sink until some part of it once again hit the floor because it is still negatively buoyant.

81333,1410047209,4,0,Fall: Week 1,,"Why wouldnt the balloon keep going up forever?  Based on our groups previous conclusions, I would respond that gravity would continue to pull down on the materials with the greatest mass/density.  Those materials with the greatest mas/densiity  will continue to be closest to the center of gravit,y while those items with less mass/density will be displaced higher and further away from the center of gravity.  At some poin,t the balloon will stop rising becuase all of the material with greater mass/density will have moved below it and stop pushing it up.  It will have settled  at the level where it ranks in its own mass/density compared with the other materials in the atmosphere.  Materials with less mass/density will continue to be displaced higher and farther from the center of gravity and the materials with more mass/density have now all been pulled closer to the center of gravity and displaced the balloon as high as it will go.  If any of these materials have a change in their mass/density over time, gravitys pull will continue to place the items in their rank order of most dense down low and least dense up high (since our main center of gravity is the Earths core).

Wow, didnt think of that.  Matt then suggested that we test it by breathing it in to see if it there was any helium in it.   Mom said that was  a bad idea an that he shouldnt do it.  So I did the Isaac Newton thing and did it for him.  Result- no helium voice. I think the balloon store has figured out the minimum helium mixture to keep the average balloon aloft until the party is over.  Then you are just left with a mixture of stale retail space air.

"
82688,1410294760,9,0,Fall: Week 1,,"I recall our discussion on equilibrium during our meetings back in August. I believe that this equilibrium is achieved because there are fewer air molecules as we ascend higher into the troposphere and stratosphere. If gravity pulls the heavier air down toward Earth while allowing the lighter gas in the balloon to ascend above it, then the balloon will float up into the air. Earth science is not my specialty, and as such, I honestly do not know why air is thinner higher in the atmosphere. However, I would have to imagine that the balloon will eventually reach a point where the &ldquo;heaviness&rdquo; of the gas inside of it matches the &ldquo;heaviness&rdquo; of atmospheric gases at a specific altitude.

 

On a related note, I&rsquo;m still wrapped up thinking about Felix Baumgartner&rsquo;s weather balloon that he did his high altitude jump from a couple of years back, which I posted about in a previous thread. I&rsquo;ll try to post a picture of the balloon, but it almost appears to be compressed and elongated as it reaches the point of equilibrium that I feel we are describing.

84190,1410632333,14,0,Fall: Week 1,,"Here is my tardy attempt (my earlier attempt seems to be lost in cyber space).

 

I like to think of the helium ballon positioning itself in a column of air like liquids of various densities would position themselves.  Assuming equal volume, the heavier liquids will layer below the lighter liquids.  The heavier liquids experience a greater pulling force by gravity.

When comparing the helium balloon with an equeal volume of air, the helium balloon is lighter and will rise above the heavier air until it reaches a point of equilibrium.  Once it reaches this point of equilibrium, it will no longer rise and actually start falling back to the surface of the earth as helium slowly escapes.

I found it interesting that the tendency of the balloon to rise or fall was very dependent on the amount of string that was cut. I&rsquo;m thinking that the balloon wants to rise due its contents being less dense than the surrounding air, and that the larger segment of cut string creates a significant imbalance in what I might call the &ldquo;pseudo-equilibrium&rdquo; (I think Paul demonstrated that a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; equilibrium doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist given our atmospheric variances), that the balloon had established. As that sort of equilibrium is broken when the string is cut, the balloon will rise due to the sudden and rather drastic change in weight that is pulling it down. However, after the immediate and drastic effect of the string being cut subsides, the remaining string still has a tendency to pull the balloon down.

 

I&rsquo;m now realizing that I have some inconsistencies in my thinking as I previously posted in agreement that heavier stuff displaces lighter stuff and now I am saying that the &ldquo;balloon wants to rise&hellip;&rdquo;

In terms of the braking car, I agree that we should expect the same outcome, only in a horizontal direction rather than vertical.

83758,1410485332,4,0,Fall: Week 2,,"Question 1: Many of the people in my department cant find Pauls video (including myself) so I am going to try to answer this question without it and hope that this works. I believe that the string holds the balloon upright because the string does not have enough weight to actually hold the balloon down. Maybe if the rock was tied to a string I would have changed my answer to this question. But if memory serves me right during the PD this summer Paul said that the string is helping keep the balloon upright because it displaces some of the air. Well this got me thinking to with the idea of floating on water, but why do things that float in water not float in air? Does this have the same concept as the balloon and the string idea? Since water keeps us buoyant then that must mean the string keeps the balloon upright (aka buoyant). To test the theory about a helium balloon staying at a height off the floor it is impossible to get it to stay a certain height unless it is tied down with a string or after a three days it began to lose its helium (my guess is the helium seeped through the balloon and air entered into its place to reach equilibrium) it would not stay off the ground unless a string was attached and it was actually holding it up. Therefore I guess I have to go back to what I wrote before and conclude that indeed the balloon is held up by the string (but I also think other forces are acting on it that I cannot explain well enough). All in all The helium balloon displaces an amount of air (just like a empty bottle displaces an amount of water in a swimming pool). As long as the weight of the helium plus the balloon fabric (plastic?) is lighter than the air it displaces, the balloon will float in the air. 

Question 2:

Well when I read the question about putting a helium balloon in a car and breaking the first thought that came to my mind was the theory of inertia which states an object in motion will stay in motion/object at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it. Well if you have a helium balloon floating in the car which is accelerating my guess is that when the car stops the balloon would move forward until it reached equilibrium and then swing back like a person would. I do not think it has anything to do with air flying forward pushing the helium balloon to the back of the car. The balloon doesnt know and doesnt care if the acceleration is from gravity or from the acceleration of the car. It just tries to move in the direction it naturally moves, namely, against the direction of the acceleration. Thus, it moves forwards when you accelerate (that is what I think). Plus - remember the car is an enclosed capsule which might have something to do with why it goes forward.
"
84152,1410567009,5,1,Fall: Week 2,,"I think that the string does add mass to the balloon and is part of what adds to the balloon moving down. This makes sense, because when you cut the string it changes the mass and the balloon&rsquo;s position changes. This is due to the change in the overall mass of the object (the balloon). When Paul cut too much of the string, he changed the mass enough that its overall mass was less and this caused the balloon to move upward until it met an equilibrium.

The balloon traveling in the car is moving just like the car is moving. When the car brakes, the balloon is still in motion and will keep moving.  Just like coffee in a Dunkin Donuts cup would keep moving, thus the invention of the plastic lid! Something else that needs to be considered is we are looking at air that is in a contained space versus an open area. Is the movement of the air is it the same under both conditions. There are many factors to think about like temperature, pressure, etc. that could make a difference in the behavior of the balloon.

Pauls thinking, questioning, and testing were absolutely brilliant.  I am not sure I would use the word inconclusive because there are some definete variables that would be very difficult to control.  Air currents and other disturbances in the house cannot be controled/stopped.  It would be interesting to see just how far away (another room) a disturbance would effect the ballons ability to position itself.

 

Wow - the idea of taking a vertical collumn and turning it horizontal is very interesting.  I would approach this idea by utilizing an empty 18 wheeler.  I would position two helium baloons so one is floating directily above the other balloon.  I would drive at 60 mph and hit the breaks.  If the theory (the heavier object travels further) holds true, the balloon floating at a lower position should move further forward.  If I had an 18 wheeler and great background music like Paul (just busting you Paul), I would video take my theory.

&lt;strong&gt;I believe, when you brake, the ballon will fall to the back.  I think when a car accelerates the pressure in the back of the car increases, and this is why a ballon will move to the front. The air crowds to the back of the car and pushes the ballon to the front.  If this is accurate, when you brake, the air pressure will move to the front of the car and it will push the ballon to the  back.  As long as the air is heavier in one section of the car the ballon will go in the opposite direction, it is the same principle of buoyancy. I do not think the Law of Buoyancy changes because the ballon is in a closed area.&lt;/strong&gt;

 

In response to the string on the balloon, I do believe the ballon will continue to rise as long as the total mass of the helium, ballon and string is less then the air.  The longer string equals a greater mass, so the buoyancy of the ballon is affected by the mass of the string which affects the overall weight of the total system, since wight and mass are directly proportional.

People in the car move forward as well (and items in the car) if the braking is hard enough, then when the car settles, most of it goes back to where it was.  If this is the case, then it could explain that the balloon is lighter than most things in the car - or would it eventually move forward if the car could brake for a longer period of time.

This makes most sense to me because I cannot make sense of a limp ribbon acting as a leg and holding it up. I know that the balloon did sometime appear to fall when the ribbon was cut but I would attribute that to the fact that it was only a small amount of the ribbon that was cut that there is a variation to the air density in the room.  Also, there are air currents so the air is constantly moving and to hard to tell with such a small piece of ribbon cut off... if you cut off enough to alter the mass of the ribbon the balloon would go up.

 

Question 2 - I think that the balloon would go forward in a car that quickly stopped because of momentum...the force would make everything in the car move forward.  Yes, the helium balloon is lighter than the air in the front of the car, however when you consider the force behind that balloon as it stops fast all of a sudden it has more power and can not displace the heavier air in the front of the car.

When a car is moving, every molecule of every object that is in any way related to the car is moving forward at a certain velocity. When the brakes are applied the vehicle stops. There is a force that starts in the wheels that causes the vehicle to stop (because the wheels are attached to the axle, which is attached to the frame, which is attached to the rest of the car). Everything that is not attached to the car (you, the balloon, etc.) will continue to move forward, due to momentum, until a force stops you. Therefore, it is not the air molecules that blow the balloon forward, but the balloons momentum itself that carries it forward.

The balloon followed my prediction and was displaced to the rear of the car.  It was kind of a sideways float.  We also tested the same balloon with a weight on it and the weight clearly pulled the balloon forward, into the denser air at the front of the compartment.  The reasoning for the balloon to move forward contradicts itself in that the description states that heavier stuff with its larger inertia  but also states tries to move against the direction of the acceleration.  Does the balloon have a will that allows it to try?  No.

The argument seems to ignore that fact that air is a mixture of gas with mass and momentum of its own while at the same time giving more inertia to the gas inside of the balloon membrane.

I think the only reason this phenomena  is puzzling is because it is a movement that occurs with a common material in a relatively uncommon situation and it appears to be a contradiction to objects that are heavier than air.

When accelerating forward in a car with a helium balloon, the balloon moves forward. Why? We believe the movement of a helium filled balloon is the result of a difference in the density of the surrounding air. On Earth, the air density is higher the lower you are in the atmosphere due to the weight of the air itself, exerting pressure on the balloon. There is less pressure on the top of the balloon than on the bottom, resulting in an unbalanced force known as the buoyant force. If this buoyant force is greater than the weight of an object, as is the case for a helium filled balloon, the object will rise in the air, moving toward the air with a lower density.

When a car stops suddenly, the air inside the car continues to move forward a little longer than the car itself, due to the tendency of an object to maintain its motion until a force acts upon on it (Newton&rsquo;s Law of Inertia). The air is stopped by the front of the cars windshield and tends to build up in this location. As a result, the air in the front of the car becomes slightly more dense than the air in the back of the car, creating more pressure on the front side of the balloon. This causes the balloon to move toward the rear of the car, where the air is less dense, just as the same balloon released outside will move upward, toward the less dense air. All in all it has to do with the motion of the air in the car. When an object is at rest and then moves forward all of the air rushes to the back of the car and a high pressure area is created in the back of the car.  Since helium is less dense than air it wants to float away from that area and move forward.

Although an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force, the helium balloon has such a low density compared to the surrounding air that momentum will not allow it to move forward in the car during a sudden stop. The substantial difference in density between air and helium causes the balloon to cease its forward motion very quickly, at which point the more dense air forces the balloon toward the back of the car. In addition to differences in density, the friction that exists between the surrounding air and the outer surface of the balloon will prevent any noticeable forward motion of the balloon as well.

If you consider the idea that the balloon is tied down within the car, the forces that are acting on it must be in balance. The forces being applied to the balloon are the gravity, the tension of the balloon and string, and the buoyant force. As the car is in motion it is moving in relation to the Earth. When the constant rate of motion changes the balloon will counteract that force. The behavior of the balloon is applied at the bottom of the balloon and the balloon will move forward at an angle when the car is decelerating and backward at an angle when the accelerates. The car itself is a vessel of air that as air particles begin to move will bump into each other causing a slight difference in the density of the air within the car. This difference causes the balloon to try to balance those forces creating these observable movements.

A factor that may influence the motion of a balloon inside a car is the tendency of a balloon to make contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior. The balloon is filled with helium and will therefore float toward the roof of the car. The roof of the car will essentially act as a force that exceeds the buoyant force of the balloon, causing the balloon to stop rising. As Paul&rsquo;s video demonstrated, a balloon is unlikely to attain neutral buoyancy even in the relative stagnancy of an enclosed space that is not in motion and does not have any noticeable air circulation. A vehicle in motion provides a much more dynamic environment. As such, it is unlikely the that the balloon will attain neutral buoyancy and suspend in mid-air inside the moving car. Since the balloon is in contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior, any motion that the car makes is likely to affect the motion of the balloon within the car. While subtle motions may not have a significant impact on the motion of the balloon within the car, a drastic change in motion, such braking and coming to a sudden stop, can have an impact on the motion of the balloon.

If the balloon maintains constant contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior during a sudden stop, there is a chance that the balloon will effectively bounce backward along the interior surface of the roof. While inertia and the higher density of the air toward the windshield of the car will prevent the balloon from moving forward, a balloon in contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior might not move backward as dramatically during a sudden stop due to friction between the balloon and the roof&rsquo;s interior. Even though the car is braking suddenly, the car will continue to move forward for a brief period of time before coming to rest. Due to friction between the balloon and the roof of the car, the balloon may continue to be pulled forward to a certain degree before being pushed back by the denser air that has moved toward the windshield of the car.

The balloon behaves much like any other object. Its behavior is due to the imbalance created due to the motion of the air. As particles move, their movements are in response to some change. This change can occur due to temperature, pressure and forces that are acting on each other. As we discovered from thinking about this example in depth, we discovered that like any other phenomena in the world of science  there is much more than meets the eye. As students of science, we are quick to except the simple and most logical answer based on what we know. This obviously has taught us that digging deeper and testing out  a scientific idea is a necessary part of truly beginning to understand an idea.

&lt;u&gt;The scenario&lt;/u&gt;: 

You are driving in your car with a helium balloon and you slam on the brakes.  Will the helium balloon move forward or backwards when the car brakes?  For the purpose of this arguement, lets assume that the car was moving forward when you braked and not moving in reverse when you applied the brakes.

 

&lt;u&gt;Forward&lt;/u&gt;:

I support the argument that the helium balloon will move forward when the brakes are applied.  The helium balloon, like me, is moving forward as a passanger inside the car while the car moves forward.  The cars momentum is what is moving me and the helium balloon along with its forward motion.  Like noted in the reading, if I were to close my eyes, I would be unaware of any sensations noting my movement forward as a passanger in car.  My experience tells me that when I apply the brakes to the car, my body will want to keep moving forward until something helps to brake my bodys forward motion (like a seat belt).  I equate the helium balloons experience in the braking car scenario to that of my bodys experience in a braking car.  I believe that the helium balloon will be moved forward by the momentum of the car moving forward.  And like me, I believe the helium balloon will continue to move forward until something helps to brake the helium balloons forward motion (like the front windshield).

 

My science experience tells me that Newtons First Law of Motion applies:  An object in motion will remain in motion at a constant speed and direction until acted upon by an outside force and an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an outside force.  Relating our scenario to Newtons First Law of Motion, there are three objects that have been set in motion - the car, me, and the helium balloon.  (There are more objects, but those are the three being discussed.)  The cars engine helps all three objects in discussion to begin moving forward.  Here, the engine is the outside force that helps the objects move from rest to motion.  For simplicity sake, lets assume for this scenario, that the car reaches and maintains a constant speed in a set direction.  Once the car is in motion, the major outside force that acts upon the cars motion is the application of the brakes.  Myself and the balloon, who were also moving forward with the cars momentum, did not have the outside force of the brakes applied directly to us, so we continue to move in the same direction and at the same speed until there is an outside force that acts upon us to stop/slow our forward motion.  Some examples of possilbe outside forces that could stop myself or the helium balloon would be a seat belt, the windsheild, the dashboard, the back of someones head, etc.

 

There is a whole lot more to the story, than noted above.  There, of course, are many more outside forces working on the three objects to slow us down besides the car braking or slaming into somehting inside the car.  Some examples of these other forces that factor in to the whole picture are gravity, friction, air resistance, acceleration/deceleration, velocity, etc.  We could fill in these variables to our story, but I do not believe that they play a role in answering the essential question posed above.  Will the helium balloon move forward or backward when a forward moving car brakes?

 

Other arguments posted above referenced the density of the objects as a factor determining if they would move forward or backward.  I argue that density doesnt predict a forward or backward movement, but instead is a factor in the amount of outside force needed to set the object in question into motion or make it stop.  I believe an object with greater density will require more outside force to set it in motion and more outside force to slow it down or stop it.  Conversly, an object with less density will, by comparison, need less outside force to set it in motion and less outside force to slow it down or stop it.  If we factor density into our scenario, I have more density than the helium balloon does.  Therefore, I would require more force to slow me down than the helium balloon would. 

 

&lt;u&gt;Backward&lt;/u&gt;:

I disagree with the arguements as to why the balloon would move backward. 

 

The first arguement uses the same concept of denser items diplacing less dense items out of the way, as the denser items are pulled lower by gravity.  However, this argument applies the idea of a density collum (more dense items dispalcing less dense items upward) to the horizontal axis of the car compared with the previously discussed perpendicular axis of the blimp in realtion to the ground.  The problem with this argument is that here on Earth, the greatest force of gravity comes from the Earth, thereby pulling more dense items toward the Earth.  The arguement above doesnt work because it places the gravitational pull toward the back of the car, not below the car toward the ground.  This argument works well when we discuss why a helium balloon floats above the ground, but does not work when we talk about objects moving forward or backward in a braking car.

 

The second arguement references an increase in the pressure at the front of the car causing the helium balloon to move backward in the car.  What I dont understand is what causes the pressure at the front of the car to increase?  How will breaking cause increased pressure?  Maybe the argument is refering to the pressure applied from the brake pads to the tires?  (Assuming we are discussing a vehicle with front wheel brakes.)  I agree in general that pressure applied to the helium balloon would cause it to go in another direction.  To relate this back to my previous connection to Newtons First Law of Motion, pressure applied to the helium balloon would be an outside force causing it to move.  However, I dont think there is pressure being applied to the helium balloon when the brakes of the car are applied.

 

In conclusion, I feel confidant that the helium balloon would move forward in a forward moving car when it brakes.

I also confused the two assignments and wrote a 4 page paper on the second half of the chapter.  Hopefully its ok.  

Here&rsquo; what I believed:

 

All the stuff will move forward:  the heavier stuff with its larger inertia moves further ahead than the lighter helium balloon.

My niece had a b&rsquo;day party and I had the task of picking up her balloons, so I did double duty and paid attention to what their behavior was on my journey to my sister&rsquo;s house.  I was also fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to be able to brake and accelerate several thousand times as I was stuck in Big E traffic!!!  I watched the behavior of the balloons while braking and accelerating - I also noticed what happened when I took turns.

Here&rsquo;s what I found:

When braking, the helium (latex) balloon did indeed move backward, not forward like the &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; items (ie. myself, my daughter&rsquo;s books on the front seat) in the car.  When accelerating, the balloon moved forward, not backward (again like the heavier items in the car).   When taking a left, the balloons went right, when taking a right, the balloons went left.  It  seemed that no matter which direction the &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; objects went, the balloons went in the opposite direction.  The balloon moves in the opposite direction no matter which direction the car goes in no matter how fast or slow the acceleration rate was either.  In thinking about this,  I thought maybe it had more to do with the air in the car vs. the motion of what is in it.  Since people and &ldquo;things&rdquo; have a greater density/mass than gases, could it be that fact that was the difference?  Gas vs gas instead of gas vs. &ldquo;solid&rdquo;.  When the car accelerates, the air in the front of the car rushes to the back, conversely the air would move toward the front of the car when braking.  When we have the balloon in a room with no air movement, the balloon moves away from the area of the highest pressure (more pressure closer to the ground) to the air with less pressure higher up (if you are in the mountains there is less pressure, so my &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; would tell me the higher in elevation something is, the less pressure it would have on it) and it would continue this upward motion if taken outside - we&rsquo;ve all seen those little kids at the parade who have let go of their balloons!  

So, in knowing that the balloon moves toward an area of less pressure, the balloon would move in the opposite direction of the area in the vehicle with the most pressure.  So when braking, the area of higher pressure is the front of the car - balloon moves toward the back.  When accelerating, higher pressure is in the back, so balloon moves toward the front.

 

Here&rsquo;s the other belief and why I don&rsquo;t think this is the answer:

The heavier (denser) air continues forward in the car creating sideways displacement---just like with gravity, heavier stuff pushes the lighter balloon out of way.

I guess my question for this would be,  wouldn&rsquo;t the balloon move toward the side?  If the only thing moving the balloon is the motion of the air, wouldn&rsquo;t it move directly backward?  In other words, what is the heavier stuff that is moving the balloon sideways?  Are we talking about objects moving through the air causing the air to move in a different direction or simply just the air movement?  And the balloon didn&rsquo;t move sideways, it moved straight back.  Unless I am thinking too literally of the term &ldquo;sideways displacement&rdquo;.

So in seeking the lesser pressure, that would be at the back of the car.  I tried to get away from the whole objects moving and pushing things out of the way.  That was my original thought, but as I watched the balloons in my car, I began thinking more about the air than other objects.

By Deanna Chelte

ED

A Helium balloon in a car is subject to specific conditions. First, the balloon has a specific density, pressure, buoyancy, and energy. It is known by many that a balloon will float in the air and it will continue to move upward if untethered. We also are familiar with the balloons ability to move in the car when the car is in motion. So what exactly happens to the balloon in a moving car and why? What direction does it move and why in that direction?

First I want to write about one of Helium&rsquo;s specific properties, density. Helium has a low density of about 0.1785 g/cm3. When compared to air surrounding it at 1.29g/cm3, Helium&rsquo;s density is very low. This difference in density allows it to rise above air, float. Density is the amount of mass or particles spread out in a specific volume. The closer together the particles, the higher the density and the farther the particles are apart the lower the density. Helium&rsquo;s particles are spread out with plenty of room between particles. Particles of air, predominately nitrogen and oxygen, are closer together comparatively. The individual particles themselves are less dense. Helium atoms are composed of, most commonly, two protons and two neutrons. That gives helium a mass of about 4. Nitrogen particles are composed of seven protons and seven neutrons with a mass of 14. Oxygen has eight protons and eight neutrons with a mass of 16.

 If a helium balloon were allowed to move freely in our atmosphere it would rise up until the density and pressure of the helium inside the balloon were equal to that of the density and pressure around it. Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure if it would make it that high. It may burst first due to other conditions I&rsquo;m not sure of. That&rsquo;s another subject.

What I mean is the atmosphere on Earth has layers of density determined by the layers of air particles. The higher up you move from Earth, the lower the density. Particles of air have mass and the more mass you place on top, the more compact the particles at the bottom become. The particles that make up air have a higher density lower to the ground and lower density the higher up you go. Close to the ground air&rsquo;s density is about 4.29g/cm3.

Second, helium has mass and takes up space. Only one type of matter can take up a specific space at any given time. Helium in a balloon maintains its volume and space within the air surrounding it. Even individual particles take up their own space so if helium were released into the air the particles individual space is constant.

Thirdly, helium particles have immense amounts of energy which determine their motion and speed. They move faster than particles of air and take up a lot more space when they move. When helium is inside a balloon the speed and motion of the particle smashing on the latex give the balloon shape and size. The latex holds the round shape as long as there is pressure on the wall of the balloon to maintain it. I know that I am relating density to pressure and that&rsquo;s because gas particles move freely and don&rsquo;t normally bond to other particles and when that happens, particles collide with other matter around them. In the case of the balloon, the particles are colliding with the latex walls of the balloon. The greater the collisions, the greater the pressure. I think that mass&rsquo;s natural ability to find equilibrium is directly related to a balloon rising in the atmosphere. So density and pressure allow balloons to have buoyancy.

This leads me to discuss the fact that helium balloons have buoyancy. Buoyancy is, when a fluid, like air, exerts an upward force on an object, a helium balloon, immersed in it equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. I do believe that the density of the helium balloon is such that it weight of the balloon never equals the weight of the air it displaces. So that allows the helium balloon to keep floating on air. If a helium balloon were an object like an ice cube, and it were placed in water, it would not fall below the top of the water line like an ice cube does. In a car, the helium balloon would stay afloat when at rest. If the balloon is not tethered it would stay at the ceiling/roof. When the car is in motion the buoyancy of the helium balloon is in a forward motion rather than vertical motion. The amount of weight of the balloon immersed in the air is not equal to the weight of the air it displaces. But once the motion of the car and the air in it equals that of the motion of the balloon, the balloon will move backward and find equilibrium and move at the same speed as the car and air particles inside.

Newton&rsquo;s law of motion comes into play with the motion of a car and the helium balloons response to it. Newton&rsquo;s law states that an object at rest will remain at rest unless an unbalanced force is introduced or causes it to change motion. In a car at rest the balloon will remain motionless floating in the air. If there is a slight change in the movement of air the balloon will respond with equal and opposite motion. When the car begins to move the balloon responds by not moving backward as we would expect, but it moves forward with the cars&rsquo; motion. The balloon will move forward because, the motion of the car causes motion of the air in the car to move backward. The air inside the car is resisting being moved and in response is forced backwards to the back of the cars&rsquo; interior. The airs&rsquo; response to the motion of the car increases pressure to the back of the cars&rsquo; interior. The balloons response is to move forward, out of the way, into less dense, lower pressure area of the car. It&rsquo;s the same a sink and float.

I made a device in my class using a soda bottle, a cork tied to a string attached to the bottle cap, added water, turned the bottle upside down, and watched the cork float inside attached to the string. This apparatus allows me to demonstrate this very topic in class. When you move the soda bottle forward, the cork floats to the forward motion of the bottle, not backward. Students love trying to explain this phenomena.

&lt;u&gt;Thinking About a Helium Balloon in a Car&lt;/u&gt;

When accelerating forward in a car with a helium balloon, the balloon moves forward. Why? We believe the movement of a helium filled balloon is the result of a difference in the density of the surrounding air. On Earth, the air density is higher the lower you are in the atmosphere due to the weight of the air itself, exerting pressure on the balloon. There is less pressure on the top of the balloon than on the bottom, resulting in an unbalanced force known as the buoyant force. If this buoyant force is greater than the weight of an object, as is the case for a helium filled balloon, the object will rise in the air, moving toward the air with a lower density.

When a car stops suddenly, the air inside the car continues to move forward a little longer than the car itself, due to the tendency of an object to maintain its motion until a force acts upon on it (Newton&rsquo;s Law of Inertia). The air is stopped by the front of the cars windshield and tends to build up in this location. As a result, the air in the front of the car becomes slightly more dense than the air in the back of the car, creating more pressure on the front side of the balloon. This causes the balloon to move toward the rear of the car, where the air is less dense, just as the same balloon released outside will move upward, toward the less dense air. All in all it has to do with the motion of the air in the car. When an object is at rest and then moves forward all of the air rushes to the back of the car and a high pressure area is created in the back of the car.  Since helium is less dense than air it wants to float away from that area and move forward.

Although an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force, the helium balloon has such a low density compared to the surrounding air that momentum will not allow it to move forward in the car during a sudden stop. The substantial difference in density between air and helium causes the balloon to cease its forward motion very quickly, at which point the more dense air forces the balloon toward the back of the car. In addition to differences in density, the friction that exists between the surrounding air and the outer surface of the balloon will prevent any noticeable forward motion of the balloon as well.

If you consider the idea that the balloon is tied down within the car, the forces that are acting on it must be in balance. The forces being applied to the balloon are the gravity, the tension of the balloon and string, and the buoyant force. As the car is in motion it is moving in relation to the Earth. When the constant rate of motion changes the balloon will counteract that force. The behavior of the balloon is applied at the bottom of the balloon and the balloon will move forward at an angle when the car is decelerating and backward at an angle when the accelerates. The car itself is a vessel of air that as air particles begin to move will bump into each other causing a slight difference in the density of the air within the car. This difference causes the balloon to try to balance those forces creating these observable movements.

A factor that may influence the motion of a balloon inside a car is the tendency of a balloon to make contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior. The balloon is filled with helium and will therefore float toward the roof of the car. The roof of the car will essentially act as a force that exceeds the buoyant force of the balloon, causing the balloon to stop rising. As Paul&rsquo;s video demonstrated, a balloon is unlikely to attain neutral buoyancy even in the relative stagnancy of an enclosed space that is not in motion and does not have any noticeable air circulation. A vehicle in motion provides a much more dynamic environment. As such, it is unlikely the that the balloon will attain neutral buoyancy and suspend in mid-air inside the moving car. Since the balloon is in contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior, any motion that the car makes is likely to affect the motion of the balloon within the car. While subtle motions may not have a significant impact on the motion of the balloon within the car, a drastic change in motion, such braking and coming to a sudden stop, can have an impact on the motion of the balloon.

If the balloon maintains constant contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior during a sudden stop, there is a chance that the balloon will effectively bounce backward along the interior surface of the roof. While inertia and the higher density of the air toward the windshield of the car will prevent the balloon from moving forward, a balloon in contact with the roof&rsquo;s interior might not move backward as dramatically during a sudden stop due to friction between the balloon and the roof&rsquo;s interior. Even though the car is braking suddenly, the car will continue to move forward for a brief period of time before coming to rest. Due to friction between the balloon and the roof of the car, the balloon may continue to be pulled forward to a certain degree before being pushed back by the denser air that has moved toward the windshield of the car.

The balloon behaves much like any other object. Its behavior is due to the imbalance created due to the motion of the air. As particles move, their movements are in response to some change. This change can occur due to temperature, pressure and forces that are acting on each other. As we discovered from thinking about this example in depth, we discovered that like any other phenomena in the world of science  there is much more than meets the eye. As students of science, we are quick to except the simple and most logical answer based on what we know. This obviously has taught us that digging deeper and testing out  a scientific idea is a necessary part of truly beginning to understand an idea.

The laws of motion explain the behaviors that occur in a car.  When a car is accelerated very quickly, the occupants are pushed against the seats of the car because, initially, the car speeds up faster than the people.  The seats provide a reactionary force to the passengers inertia pushing back on the seats causing the seats to push forward against the people and, ultimately, the people travel at the same speed as the car.  Conversely, when a car traveling at 60 mph slams on its brakes, the car slows down sooner than the occupants.  For a moment the occupants are still traveling at 60 mph.  Because the occupants are now traveling faster than the car, they move forward and the seat beats push back preventing them from going through the windshield.  The heavier people have a greater inertia and therefore their changes in position occur with more force and feel the seat belt push them back with greater force.  When there are other sudden changes in the direction of movement, the occupants take a moment &ldquo;to catch up with the car&rdquo;.  

This same concept can be applied to other &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in the car, such as helium balloons dealing with forces in relation to air in the car just as people deal with seat belts while the car accelerates and decelerates.

  
 

&lt;strong&gt;Our Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;

Lets say there are two &ldquo;helium/air&rdquo; combination balloons in the car.  The balloons are exactly the same size.  One balloon system is heavier/denser than the other balloon due to the added mass of a binder clip.  The lighter balloon will float higher than that of the heavier balloon.  Both balloons have inertia with the heavier balloon having more inertia than regular air and the lighter balloon will have less inertia than air.  It now stands to reason, that the heavier balloon will move forward and the lighter balloon will move backwards when the brakes are suddenly applied.  We will attempt to replicate this hypothesis by safely driving a car with helium balloons and changing the speed suddenly.

&lt;strong&gt;Materials&lt;/strong&gt;


	helium balloon (25% helium, 75% air)
	
	
	paper clips
	
	
	automobile
	
	
	safe driving range
	
	
	video equipment
	
&lt;strong&gt;Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;


	Obtain a helium balloon
	
	
	Float the balloon in the back of the car
	
	
	Drive the car at 25 mph
	
	
	suddenly stop car
	
	
	video record the behavior of the balloon
	
	
	add paper clip to the same balloon (float balloon at a lower position in car)
	
	
	drive the car at 25 mph
	
	
	suddenly stop the car
	
	
	video record the behavior of the balloon
	
 

&lt;strong&gt;Data/Results&lt;/strong&gt;

 

We tried the experiment two times without weight from 25 mph and also observed the balloon when the car accelerated to the target speed (see table below).  When the car was rapidly stopped the balloon clearly moves, relative to the cab of the car, to the rear and not toward the front or direction of travel.   Conversely, when the car accelerated the apparent movement of the unweighted balloon within the cab was forward in the direction of travel.    In the second step we added a single medium binder clip to the balloon (it was fresh from the store and had not exchanged/lost much helium yet).  Because it was now no longer floating (negatively buoyant), we clipped it to the sunroof so it was hanging down.  When we repeated the experiment, the balloon behaved in the opposite manner:  When accelerating the car the balloon showed apparent movement toward the back of the car and when stopping the balloon moved forward in the direction of travel.

		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;

Our data seems to support our hypothesis in that the &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; balloon with the added clip moved forward when the car was braking while the helium balloon without the weight moved toward the rear of the vehicle under the same circumstances.  It appears that our heavier balloon was acting as we predicted for an object that is heavier than the fluid that is surrounding it.    While all matter in the car continued to press forward on breaking, the heavier balloon with the metal clip had much more momentum than that of the surrounding air.  This phenomena can be explained by the understanding that the ambient air in the vehicle had more inertia than the unweighted balloon based on its density and was able to push the unweighted helium balloon out of the way (and therefore toward the back of the passenger compartment).  The ambient air all rushed forward when the car was braking and created pressure on the unweighted helium balloon forcing it backwards.

Our prediction which was supported by the data was based on the argument that the denser object has more momentum per unit volume and displaces the less dense matter.  Just as a bowling ball falling through the sky displaces heavier air as they are both pulled on by gravity, the binder clipped helium balloon traveled forward displacing the air due to the force of the car braking (and backwards when accelerating).

 

It was interesting to see both the force of gravity causing displacement as well as the braking of the car at the same time.  In the case of the car accelerating with the less dense unbinder clipped balloon gravity pulled on the denser air more displacing the less dense balloon upwards.  As the car accelerated, the less dense balloon was also displaced backwards causing the balloon to point diagonally back and up, a combination of the two resulting displacement forces.  During the deceleration with the weighted balloon the denser balloon was displacing air upwards (as far as the tether allowed) and the weighted balloon displaced the less dense air towards the back of the car resulting in the balloon to hand diagonally down and forward due to the two displacement forces occurring.

 

we do not believe the motion observed was caused by differences in air pressure in the back or front of the car as the vehicle decelerated or accelerated.  There likely was a slight barometric difference between the front and back of the vehicle due to accelerating and decelerating but not enough to cause the kind of motion observed.  The force of air pressure at sea level is too great to be unbalanced that much over such a short distance due to such a small braking or accelerating force.  Air will fill any container it is provided equally.  The strength of air pressure can be witnessed on any of a number of youtube videos with amazing results.  Oil drums are caved in due to vacuum pressure and class cases shattered with glass shards flying all over a room due to air attempting to fill a void.

 

The predictions posted on the assignment for the helium moving forward don&rsquo;t work when reasoned out either.  The prediction that the helium balloon resists change in motion is invalidated when you consider all objects resist change, including that of the denser air.  The prediction that the helium balloon tries to move against the direction of the acceleration is also disproved when you consider the air is under the same conditions and the air overcomes the balloons tendencies.  The prediction that all stuff moves forward is invalidated because yes, all the stuff is affected by the deceleration, but you also have to take into account the effect the denser air will have on the balloon as well as the force of the balloon wanting to continue forward.  The fact that the balloon also has momentum is easily overcome by the displacing force of the regular air.  The last prediction that the balloon moves forward because it too has momentum is disproved when you take into account the displacement forces provided by the surrounding air which are under all of the same conditions.

It is very fascinating how, for just a moment, the forces of gravity pulling towards the center of earth are superceded by the forces of the moving vehicle.  With that said, the movment of the air pushing the less dense helium balloon backwards caught me by surprise for a moment.  Your explanation and our experimentation all make sense to me now.

When we talked about the effects of speeding up and slowing down on the passengers, the people are all much denser than air.  Therefore, we naturally move forward during breaking and move backwards during accelerations.  During these slight changes in position, we are actually displacing the less dense air around us.

When we apply these same principles to the less dense balloon, the balloon now gets displaced by the more dense air surrounding the balloon.  During breaking, the balloon gets pushed back by the more dense air that moves forward until it hits the windshield.  During acceleration, the opposite happens with the more dense air moving towards the back of the car unitl it hits the back window.

You can see this on YouTube, in the video Paul, Greg, and I posted, or try it yourself.  It is rather cool to observe this counter intuitive event happen.  When you see it, it then makes a lot more sense.

The gases can re-arrange when the car changes speed and re-eastablish an equilibrium when the car reaches a more less constant speed again.  Unlike the human occupants, there is actually a lot of room for the gases to move and deflect off the interior of the car.  As the gases move around due to the changes in motion, they are pushing the other  gases (more or less dense) around causing changes in position until the constant speed and equilibrium are re-established.

I wrote my whole paper about Newtons First Law and was convinced, like you, that the balloon would move forward when the brakes were applied.  I was wrong, but I still dont get why.  Your arguement about denser things displacing less dense things out of way makes some sense, but I thought that density functioned with gravity and gravity pulls down not forward or backward.

Thanks for writing what you did.  Ive been frustrated and not understanding how density of air v.s. denisty of the balloon could be a factor.  Gravity pulls items down (here on Earth) so how could gravity, a funciton of density, pull denser items forward or backward?  Your words have helped me begin to get a picture of how the denser items (the air) will build up at the front of the car when it breaks.  Its not because of gravity, its because the denser items (the air) need more force to slow them down and are slamming into/building up at the front of the car.  Meanwhile, the less dense item (the balloon) needs less force to slow down and is displaced toward the back of the car because the more dense air got to the front of the car first.  I hope Im getting this right.  I thank you because I had no ideas of how to explain what we actually saw until I read this.  I also liked your comment at the end about digging in deep :)

Becky, Amy, and I came to pretty much the same reasoning as you described in your paper: The balloon will move backward upon braking and forward upon acceleration as air molecules within the car are quickly carried forward/backward when the car is braking/accelerating. Interesting question you posed about sideways displacement. I guess I assumed that that more dense air would simply move around the balloon in a relatively even manner, but this would probably not be the case, particularly with the odd surface area of a mylar balloon (seams, relatively flat face, etc.).

The Helium Balloon in a Car

By Deanna Chelte

ED

A Helium balloon in a car is subject to specific conditions. First, the balloon has a specific density, pressure, buoyancy, and energy. It is known by many that a balloon will float in the air and it will continue to move upward if untethered. We also are familiar with the balloons ability to move in the car when the car is in motion. So what exactly happens to the balloon in a moving car and why? What direction does it move and why in that direction?

First I want to write about one of Helium&rsquo;s specific properties, density. Helium has a low density of about 0.1785 g/cm3. When compared to air surrounding it at 1.29g/cm3, Helium&rsquo;s density is very low. This difference in density allows it to rise above air, float. Density is the amount of mass or particles spread out in a specific volume. The closer together the particles, the higher the density and the farther the particles are apart the lower the density. Helium&rsquo;s particles are spread out with plenty of room between particles. Particles of air, predominately nitrogen and oxygen, are closer together comparatively. The individual particles themselves are less dense. Helium atoms are composed of, most commonly, two protons and two neutrons. That gives helium a mass of about 4. Nitrogen particles are composed of seven protons and seven neutrons with a mass of 14. Oxygen has eight protons and eight neutrons with a mass of 16.

If a helium balloon were allowed to move freely in our atmosphere it would rise up until the density and pressure of the helium inside the balloon were equal to that of the density and pressure around it. Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure if it would make it that high. It may burst first due to other conditions I&rsquo;m not sure of. That&rsquo;s another subject.

What I mean is the atmosphere on Earth has layers of density determined by the layers of air particles. The higher up you move from Earth, the lower the density. Particles of air have mass and the more mass you place on top, the more compact the particles at the bottom become. The particles that make up air have a higher density lower to the ground and lower density the higher up you go. Close to the ground air&rsquo;s density is about 4.29g/cm3.

Second, helium has mass and takes up space. Only one type of matter can take up a specific space at any given time. Helium in a balloon maintains its volume and space within the air surrounding it. Even individual particles take up their own space so if helium were released into the air the particles individual space is constant.

Thirdly, helium particles have immense amounts of energy which determine their motion and speed. They move faster than particles of air and take up a lot more space when they move. When helium is inside a balloon the speed and motion of the particle smashing on the latex give the balloon shape and size. The latex holds the round shape as long as there is pressure on the wall of the balloon to maintain it. I know that I am relating density to pressure and that&rsquo;s because gas particles move freely and don&rsquo;t normally bond to other particles and when that happens, particles collide with other matter around them. In the case of the balloon, the particles are colliding with the latex walls of the balloon. The greater the collisions, the greater the pressure. I think that mass&rsquo;s natural ability to find equilibrium is directly related to a balloon rising in the atmosphere. So density and pressure allow balloons to have buoyancy.

This leads me to discuss the fact that helium balloons have buoyancy. Buoyancy is, when a fluid, like air, exerts an upward force on an object, a helium balloon, immersed in it equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. I do believe that the density of the helium balloon is such that it weight of the balloon never equals the weight of the air it displaces. So that allows the helium balloon to keep floating on air. If a helium balloon were an object like an ice cube, and it were placed in water, it would not fall below the top of the water line like an ice cube does. In a car, the helium balloon would stay afloat when at rest. If the balloon is not tethered it would stay at the ceiling/roof. When the car is in motion the buoyancy of the helium balloon is in a forward motion rather than vertical motion. The amount of weight of the balloon immersed in the air is not equal to the weight of the air it displaces. But once the motion of the car and the air in it equals that of the motion of the balloon, the balloon will move backward and find equilibrium and move at the same speed as the car and air particles inside.

Newton&rsquo;s law of motion comes into play with the motion of a car and the helium balloons response to it. Newton&rsquo;s law states that an object at rest will remain at rest unless an unbalanced force is introduced or causes it to change motion. In a car at rest the balloon will remain motionless floating in the air. If there is a slight change in the movement of air the balloon will respond with equal and opposite motion. When the car begins to move the balloon responds by not moving backward as we would expect, but it moves forward with the cars&rsquo; motion. The balloon will move forward because, the motion of the car causes motion of the air in the car to move backward. The air inside the car is resisting being moved and in response is forced backwards to the back of the cars&rsquo; interior. The airs&rsquo; response to the motion of the car increases pressure to the back of the cars&rsquo; interior. The balloons response is to move forward, out of the way, into less dense, lower pressure area of the car. It&rsquo;s the same a sink and float.

I made a device in my class using a soda bottle, a cork tied to a string attached to the bottle cap, added water, turned the bottle upside down, and watched the cork float inside attached to the string. This apparatus allows me to demonstrate this very topic in class. When you move the soda bottle forward, the cork floats to the forward motion of the bottle, not backward. Students love trying to explain this phenomena.

Finally someone that writes with a little humor...I do not know how many times I can read about a balloon. A balloon goes up...the balloon goes down...the end! I feel like I am in a bad Planet Fitness commercial about balloons!!! NO MORE AWHHH!!!! On a positive note - the paper Becky, Chris, and I wrote we agree with some of your thoughts on what happens to the balloon. I too tried to think about my body in a car and how it would react if I pressed on the break. All I could think of was inertia. I then couldnt keep anymore suspense and had to watch a Youtube video of someone who actually took the time out of their busy lives to do this experiment. My theory was proven incorrect and I then had to go back and rethink why the balloon follows the driver. I really like how you are using this in your classroom to assist you in your thinking of the balloon. We too teach about Newtons Laws of Motion and I have never really thought about putting a balloon in the car and testing it out. Now I have a different insight on balloons and how they work in cars...yes!

I think it has to do with an enclosed system and maybe adding more mass to the balloon altered the outcome. I am going to piggy back off of what Becky said and agree that it is important to understand that the process that you followed is exactly what we the 6th grade is teaching our students. We are trying to have them start with a question and discuss it as a class. From that discussion begin to formulate a process to eliminate those questions one by one to help to strengthen your idea.

At what point did your kids beg you to stop?  Ha Ha-  I know that my Jessica starts to run the other way when I start talking about the balloon.   Great job breaking it down and asking some key questions.  This gets right back to that Einstein quote about if we cant explain it simply then we dont understand it well enough.   I started thinking about your buoyancy and inertia question and the more I think about it I will say that they are two independent forces.  Until this course I would have said that buoyancy is linked to gravity but now I see that it can also respond to what I will call the net inertia of a system (I just totally made that phrase up).   So am I saying they are linked? No but they can have and effect on each other.

88472,1412034752,1,1,Fall: Week 4,...the full cup has the pressure of the atmosphere pushing down...,"Not sure how to post for Colleen, Jen and myself so I am just coping what we wrote:

When a siphon is created, a fluid is moved from a full cup to an empty cup through a straw or tube. In order for this to work, the full cup must be higher than the empty cup and you must suck the air out of the tube/straw to make the liquid move to the empty cup. The water in the full cup has the pressure of the atmosphere pushing down on it, but this alone is not enough to make the water move up the tube and into the empty cup. It has to be a combination of the air pressure pushing down on the water in the full cup and the lower air pressure at the empty end of the tube. When you suck on the end of the tube, you create a lower area of pressure at the end you are sucking on because you have removed the atmospheric pressure from that end of the tube. Fluids will flow from the area of higher pressure to the area of lower pressure. So, the fluid will move from the high pressure area (the full cup with the atmospheric pressure pushing on it) to the low pressure area, the end of the straw you sucked on.

 

Gravity also plays a role in this. Because the empty cup is lower, the pull of gravity is slightly increased to the lower cup. Gravity increases as the distance between two objects is reduced. So, the empty cup is slightly closer to the Earths center, by being lower than the full cup, it has a slightly elevated gravitational pull. These forces combine to create enough force to move the liquid up out of the full cup and then down into the empty cup.

 

Siphons are common in a few different areas that we could think of, one being the fish tank suction cleaner. It has to be moved rapidly up and down to create a suction. Once the suction catches the water then moves quickly up the tube and down to the bucket that has been placed the end in. Also, the water in a pool (above ground) that is in need of being lowered so it can be closed at the end of the season. A siphon hose is put into it and once the water starts to come through it (by either sucking on the hose or using a hand pump-thing to get it going), the hose is lowered to the ground so the water can continue to flow out of the pool. It has to do with the pressure of the water going into the hose (where there is less pressure).

How does a Siphon Work?

Deanna Chelte

 

I really have to say that I use the siphon to empty water from my pool when it&rsquo;s too full and I use this method to remove water from the cover of my pool when its&rsquo; too full. I haven&rsquo;t given it much thought before now; I just know that it works. How I do it is two ways, one is better than the other. Either I suck the water through the hose until the hose is full enough to start suction, or I fill the hose with water in the pool and pull one end out until the water runs out through the hose to the lawn.

I believe that pressure is the primary mechanism in this phenomenon. Once you get suction in the tube, like a vacuum, and place the end of the tube below the primary water line, all it takes is pressure to move water from a higher level to a lower level.

I think what is going on the pressure from the high end of the hose pushes the water to a lower location. Although, I&rsquo;m not too sure what makes the water rise up to move over the edge of the pool first before it falls down and out of the pool. But, once there is enough pressure at the top of the hose, that which is hanging over the edge of the pool, pressure keeps it going.

With the cups and siphon, I found that if you use a closed container, like a jar with a lid, with the siphon, it does not work no matter what. I tried a few things and this one really doesn&rsquo;t work. So an open container on the high end works. Maybe it has something to do with air and vacuum suction. If you close off the suction of air it stops. That means that air pressure is needed on top of the water to push it down as it continues to flow up and over the side to the lower cup.

So maybe it is not all about the water pressure, it&rsquo;s more about the air pressure. Maybe air pressure is pushing down on the water and that is what causes the water to flow through a siphon.

I was also thinking, what would happen if you raise the arch of the tube coming out of the cup? Would it still flow? I really need to try this next.

By making sense of the straw in a liquid it helps to support the idea of a siphon. Water moves because there is less resistance in one area opposed to another.So as we think about everything having mass, the amount of gravitational pull an object has varies based on mass and volume. So as we think about this motion of water, we soon realize that there is a whole lot of pushing and pulling going on.

You guys provided me with a few thoughts to think about. I never really thought about a liquid not easily being able to be compressed, so I want to think more about this and how it relates to the siphon. The other idea of an imbalance really helps support my idea of why the water moves. This imbalance creates particle movement and continues until an equilibrium is met.

I like the way you started off with a simple analogy comparing the siphoning to a straw placed in a drink.  It allowed me to add some new ideas to how the mechanism of siphoning works.  Like you guys, I was thinking that gravity pulls on the fluid and air pushes on the fluid.

As I explore the many siphoning scenarios, I still agree with gravity.  There is an equilibrium that gets established as gravity pulls on a liquid.  Showing the cups at various levels relative to one another nicely models how gravity adjusts the levels depending on the position of each cup relative to the other cup.  However, I am starting to question what role air pressure plays.  Air is definitely pushing on the fluid when the system is open.  Air is so easily compressed and so much less dense than the liquid, I now think the flow of the liquid easily overcomes any pushes by the air.

You said the tube has to be completely full of the fluid in order for the siphoning process to work.  I disagree.  I believe the fluid in the FLEXIBLE tube simply has to be below the fluid level in the original cup in order for the process to start and continue.  Try it &ndash; I did.

I will get back to you in regards to air pushing on the fluid.  I am going to try the siphoning with a completely closed/sealed container that will not allow air to enter as the fluid is siphoned (attempted siphoning).   I am now thinking that it is not air pushing as much as air being pulled in to replace the space created by the evacuating fluid.  Something has to fill the void created by the fluid leaving.  So is it air pushing on the fluid or air being pulled by the fluid as it leaves (maybe it is both because these are the same actions; space filled by the fluid molecules being filled by air molecules)?
"
89174,1412425926,2,1,Fall: Week 4,...ideas about how gravity and pressure play a role in the...,"I like your ideas about how gravity and pressure play a role in the siphoning of a fluid from one container to another container.  I think gravity plays a very big role and air pressure a much smaller role.  The fluid is much more dense and much less compressible than the air.  Gravity pulls the more dense fluid below the less dense air under normal circumstances.  When a siphon is introduced and the second container is positioned below the original container the fluid will flow into the lower container through a tube due to the pull of gravity.  I disagree with the part about lower pressure.  I like the idea of fluids moving from a higher to a lower pressure, but the fluids have to be in the same &ldquo;state of matter&rdquo;.  Try filling the tube part way.  As long as the water level in the tube is below the water level in the original container, the flow will continue and the fluid will travel to the second container.  The air does not have to be completely removed from the tube, thus lessening the air pressure in order for the flow to occur.  Try it!

I am struggling with what role the air/air pressure plays, because I do know air is pushing on the liquid.  I am going to try the siphoning with a completely sealed and a partially sealed container.  I am not so sure siphoning will work at all with a completely sealed container.   I think it will work very slowly with a slightly sealed container.  I know that as the fluid leaves the original container, air will take the place of the liquid.  If the newly evacuated space is not filled, I don&rsquo;t think the siphoning will occur.

VD 1: Back in the day people were not nearly so conscientious about safety hazards such as smoking around flammable materials. Having a lit cigarette near the car when the gas cap is sealed is a pretty safe risk, but a lit cigarette near a siphoning devise is a rather risky activity. 

VD 2: The water goes to the lowest point due to gravity.  Gravity is pulling on the fluids in and around the cup.  The fluids include the liquid in the cup, the air above the fluid in the cup, and all the air above and surrounding the cup.  Because the fluid is heavier per unit of volume, it displaces any gas.  Thus it fills the bottom of the cup.

VD 3: The forces affecting the balancing act are gravity pulling the liquid and air pushing the liquid from above.  When you put a straw in a drink, the straw fills to the same level as the drink due to these forces.  As I play around, I am starting to reconsider what role air pressure really plays.  If I put the straw in the water with my finger at the top, the fluid does not enter the straw because my finger prevents the water from pushing the air out the top.

VD 4: I will be honest. My team did not discuss our final paper before submitting.  We started the paper and then each of us took a turn adding to the original thoughts via google doc.  I did not see the phrase &ldquo;vacuum pressure&rdquo; until reading your comments.

My interpretation of the siphoning is probably due to a vacuum process (I am not sure what the definition of a vacuum process is however), but I believe my explanation is a bit more simplistic.  The water travels in a one way direction (rather than some of the fluid falling back into the original container and some falling into the new container) because of gravity.  The siphon is like an escape point for the fluid.  Gravity is pulling on the fluid in the original cup so it starts up the tube.  If the tube is completely full of the fluid and placed in another cup, gravity will now pull the fluid on the other end of the tube into the new cup as long as the fluid in the tube is below the fluid level in the original cup.  The flow will continue until the levels in both cups are the same.

Now I am wondering what would happen if you interrupted the flow by pinching the tube.   Would the flow start up again when you stop pinching the tube?  As long as there is no compressible gas in the tube, the flow should start up again.  

VD 5:

In question 4 I wondered if siphoning would still occur if there was a partial cover on the original cup that interfered with air pressure.  What I decided to do was use a mason jar with a hole in the lid that was slightly larger in diameter compared to the tube.  I started the siphoning and the fluid flowed into a cup at a lower level.  The flow seemed to be slower than when the mason jar did not have a lid.  I decided to unscrew the lid on the mason jar.  The flow seemed to speed up.  I am now wondering if the height of the column of liquid in the mason jar makes a difference.

In question 5 I wondered if siphoning would occur if there was a cover that completely interfered with air pressure and the ability for air to fill the space vacated by the siphoned fluid.  When the original cup is completely sealed to the outside air, I was able to &ldquo;suck&rdquo; water through the tube into my mouth, but the water returned back into the original mason jar when I let the tube out of my mouth.

Tonya, your comments on the velocity of the fluid got me thinking in whole other direction-   The term fluid velocity got me trying to remember what (Dan?) Bernoulli postulated and eventually it turned into laws. (Being ignorant of the law does not excuse me from obeying it).

A given sized air bubble in the tube will interrupt the flow.  I believe the reason lies in the nature of gases and liquids.

IOW,  gases have an indefinite volume, as we know, and will not pass on the change in pressure as effectively as a liquid in the entire tube system.

I like how you said, when you suck on the tube, you are removing the atmospheric pressure from the tube which creates the lower pressure at the end you were sucking on.  Is it because the water has already begun to flow that the atmospheric pressure no longer affects the straw once you remove your mouth and it is open to the air.  The air cant get through because water will fill the entire space of whatever it is in, or is it the gravitational pull that keeps the seal and that is why the straw must be bent downward to continue the flow? Maybe it is a combination of the two.

I also agree that there is a speed or acceleration factor that functions in conjunction with gravity. We couldnt really articulate exactly what this factor meant other than to simply call it momentum. You talk about pouring liquid directly from one cup to another in order to illustrate this concept. It makes sense to me that the liquid will flow faster when there is a greater difference between the elevation of the two cups.

I, too, am not exactly sure how to explain the upward motion of the liquid beyond factoring in the weight of air (atmospheric pressure), on the liquid that is in the cup from which liquid is siphoned. Once siphoning begins and the flow of liquid has been established, it makes sense that gravity pulls the liquid down, but I too am still wrestling with the idea of air pressure assisting in keeping the liquid flowing up the tube before gravity takes over and pulls it down after the liquid passes the apex of the tube.

My wife and I have two red-eared slider turtles (I know, weird!), and we have to siphon the water from their tank once every month or so to clean it. We typically fill one end of the hose with the aquarium water while plugging the other end with our thumb. Once the hose is completely filled with water and the plugged end is placed below the tank in a 5-gallon bucked, water flows.

I am so glad that you tried this in a relatively closed system as well because one of the factors that we thought contributed to the ability of water to flow, particularly up the tube, is the weight of air (air pressure). One thing that I noticed when we change our aquarium water is that as the water in the aquarium lowers, the flow of water decreases even though the bucket is still well below the water in the aquarium. This, along with your test showing that a siphon wont function when the top cup is sealed, leads me to believe that the weight of the air pushing down on the surface of the water does in fact play a substantial role in the siphoning process.

VD2: I think all we were saying is that a liquid will flow to the lowest point in a cup.  this comment was in the paper most likely because in the prior discussion we were discussing gasses and gasses fill a containers entire volume equally whereas a liquid will keep its volume and settle towards where gravity pulls it.  When a siphon is introduced that allows water to go to a new lowest point within the system of the two connected reservoirs.

 

VD3: Im not crazy about how we worded that one.  Im imagining the forces discussed are the forces each container is under due to gravity.  Gravity will be pulling on the water in the tube that is lower than the upper reservoir until the fluids in the two reservoirs are at an equal height above the ground.  Vacuum pressure as mentioned in our paper is the force that allows water to pull water up a hose as the water is dumped out of the lower end.

VD4:  If I am reading your question correctly you are asking why doesnt the water just flow down the downward angle its at with respect to its place in the curved siphon tube.  that is because for a siphon to work there has to be nothing but the fluid inside the siphon.  When the siphon is full of water the water behaves like a really bendable solid in that it acts like a tube within the tube...the particles will intermingle unlike a solid but it will maintain its shape in that it will always be filling the tube...when one side gets pulled on more the other side responds accordingly.

VD5: I havnt tried it but I would imagine it wouldnt work either.  The water emptying out of the upper reservoir would need air (or anything really) to take its place or there would be a vacuum pressure stopping the siphon from working

I liked your two arguments as well.

Pressure in the tube is not the same throughout. There must be low pressure at one end and high pressure in the other. I think that there is low pressure at the end that is draining and high pressure at the end in the liquid to be moved. Although there might be a pressure differentiation in the tube moving up and over the edge of the first container of liquid. Maybe the pressure is low at first at the beginning, then as it rises up to the cups edge it gains pressure and as it falls over the edge it becomes low again.  Low pressure creates a vacuum like movement, whether its in a tube or with weather. We all know that a low pressure system, with weather, can create some nasty storms. I think thats because low pressure systems create a vacuum and sucks up the surrounding moisture and cool air from the ground to the atmosphere. This causes unbalanced forces to stir up cloud formation, friction and wind. Thus you get storms.

&lt;strong&gt;Pushes&lt;/strong&gt; &ndash; I believe air pressure plays a role because an air tight container cannot be siphoned.  Even with a loosely fit lid, siphoning still occurs.  I believe air pressure plays a role because I know air is pushing on the liquid from above, whether the container is an open container or a container with a loosely fit lid.  Secondly, as the liquid is transferred to another container, as the air pushes on the exiting liquid, it also fills the vacated space.   I would like to come up with a way to quantify the role gravity plays in siphoning versus air pressure.  Not there yet.

In regards to air bubbles in the tube, I believe a pinch in the tubing at a height above the level of water in the original container will create an air bubble that will disrupt the siphoning flow.  The flow will stop because air can be expanded or compressed.  The air will be stretched causing the liquid to flow backwards back into the original container.

&lt;strong&gt;Pulls&lt;/strong&gt; - Water is more dense than air.  Therefore, as gravity pulls on both fluids, water is always moving to the lower/lowest position.  When tubing is introduced without sucking on the other end, the water simply enters the tube to the same level as the as the container.  If you suck on the straw a little bit, and then let go, the water falls back into the original container because gravity pulls it back.  If you suck on the straw enough to get the water level in the straw below the level in the container, gravity will pull the water into the new container and air pressure will maintain the flow until the water in the original container has all siphoned into the new container or the level in both containers are equal.

I am in agreement on the idea that the air pressure on the surface of the liquid will not push a liquid in a straw &ldquo;up&rdquo;.     If we consider that the air is also pressing on the liquid inside the end of the straw they are then in balance. 

 

I don&rsquo;t know where to view the pink straw video so I will have to go on your description.  

 

The siphon only works when gravity pulling  column throws that balance out of equilibrium and the fluid begins to flow.

 

I will disagree on one point and that is the size and shape of the container matters.   David Powell demonstrated to me that when he siphoned from the top layer of liquid then his outflow occurred at one rate but when he put the siphon a the bottom of the top container.   In this case we have the air pressure on the liquid and then also the pressure of the liquid itself pushing on the intake siphon opening.

 

So then I wonder why that additional pressure is not enough to push the liquid up higher than the fluid surface in the reservoir container?    I have the air pressure, and I have the weight of the water (like water pressing on your eardrums) while on the other end of the straw I have just the air pressure?  Is it just the weight of the water in the straw above the water level?

Regarding point four, five &amp;amp; six:  A siphon does also work with large air bubbles in it.  How does this play out with the assertion that siphons work with liquids because they are not compressable?  How much air (maybe percentage wise) would a working siphon tolerate?  I am going to suggest that perhaps the diameter of the hose is a factor- a larger hose diameter may be less forgiving of a bubble.  Would a siphon function with 50% bubble?  (I predict that as long as the liquid volume below the reservoir line is greater than the upside, then the amount of bubbles won&rsquo;t stop the flow.)

 

The discussion in point seven made me start thinking of solids as described, they are flexible which would make them liquids.  I think the use of solids in this mind experiment is not working because for them to work they would not follow the definition of a solid (definite volume and shape).  Perhaps if we were talking about a powder because then the shape could change but then that includes a gas also so it does not work for the mind experiment either.   I think bringing a solid into this discussion distracts the concepts from what we are trying to focus on which is the &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; of matter when some of it is pulled.  Does not a liquid definition not also follow this same rule (definite volume)?

Im laughing because Donna and I did look at how viscosity affected the flow of the liquid (which you were wondering about) and you focused many of your experiments on what affects the rate of flow, specfically on the downward side of the siphon straw.  Together our thoughts have potential to compliment one another nicely!  :) 

 

I do have a few questions.  When you were listing points you have learned from your experiments, you used the phrase feeding container is shorter in height on points #4 &amp;amp; 5.  Were you referring to the height of the liquid in this feeding container?  Height of the container from the ground? Height of the actual sides of the container? If it was the last one, did the size of the base of the container change when the height of the sides of the container became shorter or taller?  Based on your data chart later, I think you mean height of the feeding container above the ground, but I want to be sure. 

 

The data chart was a very helpful way for me to relate to what you did and understand your results on this part.  I agree that gravity does seem to be at work here in a major way.  I think that what happens to get the fluid up the straw on one side is connected but different than what happens to keep it moving downward on the other side.  I think that gravity plays a role on the downward side of the siphon straw by pulling the liquid down.  I connect this to your comments about the liquids potential energy at the top bend in the siphon straw to its kinetic energy as it actually flows down other side of the straw.  To me, it seems that all of your varied experiments support this. 

 

Our experiment with viscosity showed that fluids with more viscosity actually moved slower.  This doesnt fit with what youre finding because I would have expected a liquid with more viscosity to have more mass and thereby a greater gravitational pull making it flow faster.  Clearly this isnt the case.  Maybe my understanding of viscosity is at fault?  What do you think? or What would you expect to see with more viscous fluids?

 

Again, more questions than answers...  back to the experiments!  :)

As the water is drawn out, something has to replace the space vacated by the water.  This happens to be the air that is pushing from above.  If air is not allowed to enter the system, a vacuum is created (I believe) and siphoning cannot happen.  In your straw experiment, water will automatically move up the straw to the same level as the water in the main reservoir due to gravity pulling the water to the lowest level.  When you were blowing on the pink straw, the air was compressing when it encountered the water and with enough blowing, the air created added (artificial) pressure from above which then forced water up the yellow straw.

I have also been thinking a lot about the start up to siphoning when you suck on the straw to get the process started.  What is the sucking really doing and how much sucking is needed?  I know that the length of the tube does not matter and the amount of sucking required does not need to pull the water all the way to the end of the tube.  I know from experimenting, as long as water is sucked in into the tubing so it is below the level of water in the original reservoir, the siphoning process will continue to completion.  Therefore, it is not the removal of air in the tubing, as much as getting water in the tubing on the &ldquo;down hill side&rdquo; of the original water level so gravity can take over and pull water into the new container.  With that said, I am now wondering if there is a way to get the siphoning started without sucking on the tube at all.  I have been using mason jars for my experiments, so I would need different containers for the experimental  part of this activity.  Here is my thought, which will be difficult to describe without experimentation and pictures.  Start with an original reservoir of water and the straw exiting from the side of the container rather than the top of the container.  The straw would exit out of the side at a point below the level of the water in the original reservoir.  At the same time, the length of tubing would be managed so no part of the pathway (tubing) into the receiving container is ever above the water level in the original reservoir.  My prediction is the water will travel to the receiving container on its own because the tubing will fill independently of sucking (removing air) and gravity will pull water into the new container which is lower than the original container.  I apologize if this is confusing.

That is so cool how you tested height.  Whenever we talked about heights, I was always referring to the difference between the delivering and receiving containers.  Not the height from which the delivery took place.  I find myself struggling with a mechanism dilemma &ndash; initially your results made sense to me.  Due to gravity, the water is being pulled to the lowest point.  With increased height, the lowest point is further away; therefore water will achieve a greater speed as it is pulled to that lowest point.

It is now day 2 of my pondering.  I am now confused by your results and wondering if the data table has &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo;.  I am having trouble with the time and rate columns.  The water reached the bottom in much less time from 60 cm, but the flow rate was much slower for the 60 cm distance.  Help me.

Another interesting thought I have is the relationship between gravity and the falling liquid.  Technically, the force of gravity will lessen as you move further from the center of the earth.  At what distance would we have to travel towards space in order for this positional change to affect the time of flow and rate of flow.  This is assuming gravity plays a role in siphoning.

Thanks for listening to Powell in the morning (play on Gilbert in the afternoon &ndash; haha).

Pushing:

#1 - I agree that the sucking is not the mechanism that causes the siphon to work, it is simply a way to fill the tube or set it up so the siphon will work.  I would not necessarily consider this part of the siphon, because you could submerge the tube in water until it is full and then set it up and it will still flow (without sucking)

#7 &ndash; Do you think that the water if flowing because of its &ldquo;attraction between molecules and surface tension&rdquo;?  I know that water behaves somewhat at a solid because once it starts flowing it continues to flow (keeping it together like a solid)&hellip;but is that due to surface tension?  I am unsure of that&hellip;I thought it had to do with differences in pressure and gravitational pull (like you argued in Pushing #2 and Pulling #16).

 

I appreciate that you thought so much about the air bubbles and how they may or may not affect the flow of a siphon.  I agree that if the bubbles are small and kept to a minimum as to not stretch the length of the tube they will not affect it.  However, I wonder if it ties in will Pulling #16.  You mention that &ldquo;the tube needs to be longer on the empty side than on the full side so that the gravitational force is greater on the empty side than the full side&rdquo;, does it really have to do with the length of the tube or the amount of liquid in the tube?  For example, isn&rsquo;t the gravitational pull greater on the empty side because it contains more liquid?  If this is true, and air bubbles were introduced&hellip;the siphon would keep flowing as long as the air bubbles were uniformly distributed throughout the tube.  However, I wonder if the longer tube side (downhill side) happened to more air bubbles than the uphill side, would the siphon still work?  I think that &hellip; if the addition of air bubbles resulted in the amount of liquid on the downhill side decreasing to the point where the uphill side contained more liquid the siphon may stop flowing because the gravitational pull on the downhill side would no longer be greater (even if the tube was longer).

Paul &ndash;

Very interesting experiments.  I appreciate the time you put into exploring how viscosity may affect the rate of flow and if the rate change relationship was comparable between water and soap.

One question I have is&hellip;are you talking about siphon height or siphon length?  On the water experiment, you refer to siphon height but when I saw 30cm and 60cm, I assume you are talking about the difference in height between the holding tank and the 500ml beaker?  I will make my comments assuming you are talking about length between the two tanks.

Questions:

Are you using the same &frac14; tube for all three heights?  If so, I would assume that the angle for the 30 cm would be much less steep than the angle for the 90 cm experiment
	Was the length of the tube on the intake side the same amount in these experiments?  (assuming you used the same length tube for all experiments, just changed the angle of the output tube)
 

In the water experiment, your results show that the siphon that had a &ldquo;height&rdquo; of 60cm (assuming this is the height difference between the intake and output) was quite a bit faster flowing that the siphon with a shorter height difference.  Do you think that you got these results because the angle of the output tube was that much steeper?  I asked the question about the length of the intake side of the tube because I was curious if this was a constant length, was the amount of liquid the same on both sides of the tubes in all of these experiments?  For example, if the tube was 100cm, was it always 10 cms on the intake side and 90 cms on the output side?

When looking at the soap results, I wonder why the rate is so similar with the 60cm and 90cm?  Also, in looking at your picture of the dish soap experiment, do you think that the length of the intake remained the same even with your &ldquo;trust worthy lab experiment&rdquo;?  I ask this because one of the explanations I have started to understand and believe for why a siphon works has to do with gravity and the difference in gravitational pull between the intake side and output side of the tube.  For example, there needs to be more gravitational pull on the output side for the siphon to flow&hellip;this increased gravitational pull is a result of there being more liquid in the output side than the input side.  In your experiment, clearly you have more liquid in the output side, but do you think that amount of liquid in the input side was consistent in the 30/60/90 experiment?  Do you think that altering the placement of where the peak of the tube is would affect your results?  Just something I have been thinking about.
"
91462,1413756174,2,0,Fall: Week 6,,"Lots of great questions and points brought up by your experiment and write up.  I would have thought your hypothesis correct in that the larger the difference of height between the two beakers the faster the flow rate.  I too was surprised it wasn&rsquo;t closer to double the height = double the flow rate.  Even though the water had to travel a greater distance I thought it would travel much faster down the tube as you would have one end of the siphon side way longer than the other side causing the water in the longer tube to have a greater pulling force (mass x acceleration) than the other side of the siphon with a smaller falling mass of water.  I thought this stronger pulling force would draw in water from the short end of the siphon tube at a faster rate because of a stronger suction.  I guess the forces impacting flowing water like internal flow friction and the friction of it flowing through a tube it has friction with could be bigger factors than I thought.

With respect to your questions on whether if the slope being less than vertical and the viscosity of the fluid make a difference I would say yes and yes due to the data you collected.  Galileo predicted and observed objects falling through air and on ramps and as long as the drag (resistive force) was basically equal the different density balls would fall or roll at the same rate and would reach the ground at the same time when dropped from the same height because they fell at this same rate.  In this case there is a longer distance to fall but still a similar amount of resistance in each tube except for one thing I&rsquo;m not sure about.  When you doubled the height you doubled the overall height but added 30mm to the vertical section of the tubing.  I bet this tripled the vertical sections height which brings about some math that is making my head hurt right now.

The viscosity would slow the flow and perhaps bring the flow to a &ldquo;terminal flow velocity&rdquo; even sooner despite higher and higher flow heights.

At the start of a regular siphoning experiment (no sealed cap) there is air pressure on all the different pieces of the experiment.  In your video, before you siphoned from a sealed bottle, the air pressure was the same everywhere.  This is why I think air pressure isn&rsquo;t what is forcing the water through the siphon.

The same vacuum pressure you use (sucking on the hose) is the same mechanism that stops the siphoning after is has moved some of the water.  When you drew out air from the tube you reduced the number of air molecules in the tube.  I think what happens as a result of this is the air pressure is no longer equal everywhere and the air on the opposite side of the tube is then pushing the fluid into the vacuum (area of fewer air molecules) you created.

When the siphoning was happening there was fewer and fewer air molecules per unit area just like drawn up in your diagram.  The fewer molecules were then creating a bit of a vacuum as the air on the other side of the hose started to push back on the water flowing out.  I think the force of the flow (causing the continuation of the flow) is the difference in length of tube above the surface of the catching reservoir vs. that of the length of tube above the surface of the contributing reservoir.  The contributing reservoir will have a shorter column of fluid in it and therefore not be getting pulled on by as great of a force as the taller/longer column of water.  When the air pressure was reduced enough inside the sealed container the difference in air pressures was able to be equalized by the one outlet the sealed container had, the siphon hose.  Eventually the difference in forces of the two water columns due to gravity was matched by the opposing force created by the difference in air pressure&hellip;.or so I think.

I guess I was thinking along the lines of thin metal wire or a sponge.  As long as the air bubbles dont have a chance to connect the end of the tube to the apex of the bend in the siphon hose and dont alter the mass of the water causing the longer hose length to have less total water than the shorter siphon hose end then I think the siphon would continue working.

That was a very creative experiemnt you conducted in proving that the water will move up the siphon tube due to air pressure from above the water.  I havent found the video yet but I am interested in watching this experiment.  You both brought up some really great points in your Siphon Refinement paper.  In #1 you mentioned that there must be a stronger pull on one side, and I have to agree that when the tube is filled with water, the greater weighted side will direct the water flow, but I also think it still goes to the fact that the liquid wants to leave the higher pressured area and move to the lower pressured area and Im not sure if this is due to the freedom it wants to find so it moves away from the intenser pressure.  I believe this also coincides with your #3 point as liquid tends to move from higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.  I tend to think of this like the old Drano commercials where there is a clog, until the intense pressure blows out the clog and moves along the pipe.  Its not as dramatic as that but it still rings in my head when I think of pressure.  

Another comment that Id like to offer is that I also believe that the water moves up the tube with such pressure behind it that it kind of defies gravity in a way.  Kind of like when people practice parachuting inside and the air blows them upward which in effect defies gravity as well.  

My only other comments:

a.  you mention the word air column in the second paragraph but Im not sure what that refers to.  

b.  the last page mentions that when you suck you are reducing pressure but isnt sucking actually another type of pressure?

Overall you did a fantastic job with your experiments as well as with the data chart.  Im a visual learner so that meant more to me than anything.  You made some great points in your paper.  I found it very interesting through your experiments that:

the higher the vertical height, the faster the water finished.  
	the higher the elevation of the liquid, the harder the liquid hits the receiving container. 
Id like to suggest that the speed in which the water falls is associated with hitting the maximum velocity thus creating a harder hit from farther above.  Whoa!!  Whered that come from?   You also mentioned in your paper that the higher the liquid is, the more potential energy it stores.  This would encompass what I mentioned that possibly, the more potential energy that is stored, the more kinetic energy is released, thus pulling the liquid down with faster speed.  

My  only questions that I pose is from your paragraph on the last page at the top.  It mentions that you thought the water would siphon faster but what you saw was the water siphoning with more power.  What is the difference between the water going faster and water with more power? 

Thank you Tonya, your experiments were eye opening in coming to a better understanding of ideas surrounding exactly how does a siphon work. 
"
91617,1413846699,1,0,Fall: Week 6,,"David, in terms of the first part of what you tried, I think from what youve shown the air filling the space above the liquid being siphoned has a lot to do with the ability of it to siphon (given the second container is below the level of the original liquid.  This is further illustrated when a closed container is used as the liquid begins to move then stops once what has been drawn into the straw comes out. Interesting idea about the sizes of the containers and the volume of air involved.  Perhaps a significantly large container above might make more of a difference.  The sizes were comparable, so could it have been &ldquo;too close to call&rdquo;?    From here you went on to the notion that a larger tube would make a difference, and to this point I would have to agree.  I say this from the experience of this past weekend.  I had to get some of the rainwater off my pool cover so my choices were the hose or a smaller pump that I used last year.  With the volume of water that I had, I knew the smaller one would take forever, so in staying with the class ideas of experimentation, I used both.  I chose two of the three areas that had the closest amount of water and set up both areas (one with the hose and one with the smaller tube set-up) and low and behold, the one with the hose emptied faster.  Of course, this is a large scale experiment and I&rsquo;m sure with my set-up it was far from perfect, but the area with the hose did empty faster - most likely because the volume of the flow was greater.  

I was a little confused with this after the experiment: &ldquo;As gravity is pulling water to the lowest point, these results suggest that gravity has a greater affect on area the water is distributed over rather than the volume the water occupies above the siphoning tube.  I now need to try a very wide bottom container.  As the area of the container increases, does the rate of siphoning increase?&rdquo;  Again, could the size need to be more exaggerated?  like using a large frying pan as the container the liquid is being siphoned to?

I noticed the same thing in terms of having to ensure that the tube must be more or less completely full of liquid in order for siphoning to initiate. You mentioned that applying enough suction to fill the tube will eventually create a downward pressure, allowing the liquid to flow. What causes the downward pressure that allows the liquid to flow? I found the thought that kept arising as you investigated the siphon (&ldquo;from an area of high concentration or pressure to an area of low concentration&rdquo;), to be very interesting. Is the downward pressure caused by the low concentration of liquid in the lower container?

 

I also never really thought about the siphon in terms of energy (potential and kinetic). Once the outside force is applied to the liquid with potential energy, the liquid gains kinetic energy. Im still wrestling with what causes the liquid to continue its flow. My initial thought was gravity. So once the liquid gains kinetic energy, it will stay in motion until an equal and opposing force acts upon it causing it to stop. In this particular case, it seems like the absence of liquid flowing into the tube from the upper container provides this &ldquo;force,&rdquo; but I have no idea how to further describe it!

91635,1413852776,4,0,Fall: Week 6,,"Hi Jenn and Donna,

Very interesting tests and an intriguing idea as to why soda will not siphon. Based on your explanation, liquids without bubbles will siphon while liquids with bubbles will not siphon. Your video demonstrates this clearly, and although I havent tested it, Im confident that flat soda will siphon without issue, although maybe a bit more slowly due to its higher viscosity. I think it makes sense that the bubbles cause siphoning to cease because gas is introduced into the tube while uninterrupted flow of liquid is necessary for siphoning to continue.

I know I am not supposed to be evaluative, but I absolutely must applaud your patience in working to get the syrup to siphon! The biggest question I have with this part of the experiment is did the syrup continue to siphon as individual drips for a certain amount of time and then stop, or did it continue to drip just like a less viscous liquid (stopping when air was introduced to the tube or when the lower container was raised)? Based on what I saw in your video, I would guess that the syrup would continue to siphon in this manner until suction is lost. Im thinking that an extremely viscous liquid like honey or molasses would require a thicker tube in order to flow based on its viscosity. Im wondering if the syrup would have flowed beyond a drip if siphoned through a hose with a wider diameter?

As I read your paper I focused on the questions that came to mind during your experimentation. When you first mentioned that the liquid hitting the receiving container is harder, the first question that came to mind was &ldquo;How do you measure that?&rdquo; After reading further in the paper you explained that it was based on your observations. That idea makes sense to me and maybe it could be a measurement of pressure. As you went on to describe the idea of potential energy in the container that is higher, that is an idea that no one else has mentioned. The idea that the higher an object. the greater it gravitational potential energy is definitely something that should be considered.

When I think about the shortness of the tube, the faster the flow of the fluid is a great observation and makes think about the motion of the fluid. How does the length affect the rate in which the fluid flows? Perhaps it is linked to gravitational potential energy?

The siphoning process slows down I believe, when it begins to come to an equilibrium of forces and pressure (air pressure and gravitational pull). As I continue to think about the changes in height of the containers and the length of the tubes, the question I have is do vertical heights change the angle that you illustrated in your diagram? Or does it just broaden it?

I feel that your hard work has really provided me with some new ideas that give me more to think about when it comes to siphoning.

I also experimented with a closed container and found that the siphoning process did not work in a closed system. This makes me think that you are in deed correct with the idea of air pressure pushing down on the fluid.

Air pressure is the mechanism that allows the movement of fluid through the tube. I believe that the air pressure is providing the force that pushes down n the water in the container. This compressed movement of particles causes the particles to seek a path of least resistance that is through the tube into the lower container. The other force to consider is gravity. This comes into play when observing the height of each container and the length of the tube between each container. These ideas really opens up more opportunities to test these new ideas to help solidify my thinking.

I believe that the taller container took longer to siphon because it is fighting gravity and it is harder when you have a steeper slope.  I think of it as rolling a boulder up a hill and how hard it is when the hill is high.  The mass of the boulder doesnt change, but the difference in heights makes it more difficult.  Does this have to do with the amount of potential energy increasing as you get higher?  

I did an experiment with tube diameter, wasnt very technical, I just used two different straws.  The larger diameter was able to siphon the water faster.  It makes sense, because the larger straw can hold more water since water will fill up and take shape of the container.  In terms of air pressure, It would be cool to see how we could play with this variable that will allow for different liquids to siphon at the same time.

In your paper you provided some interesting theories and clearly explained you and your students thinking. I connected with your theory that an outside force was necessary to start the movement of the water. I still think that you need to remove all of the air inside the tube in order for it to continue moving freely into the container that is located below the container of water (liquid). I am still not quite sure why and how this happens but am still at the point that all air must be removed first. Katie and I have concluded that once the water is allowed to move freely that gravity takes over and allows the water to continue to empty into the container. I like how one of your students took the container and made it even with the container of water and you observed the siphon stop working. I am still not 100% sure this happens because of the greater force on the other side. It is what makes sense to me. 

Katie and I created an experiment where we used a closed system to see if the water would still flow. We provided extra force by blowing into a straw we put in the cup with liquid. I was lucky enough to be the one who got to blow into the straw. It took a lot of force but, eventually the water did begin to siphon out. 

I am now intrigued as to whether the change in a liquid would make a difference, such as using a thicker liquid. I thought this was a great idea to expand on. Without doing this experiment I am going to predict that it would work but, would need a greater outside force. Not sure if I or anyone could provide that force or if it would have to be mechanical in nature.

I had to respond to Colleens paper as well as yours, which was great given the fact that she referenced yours. I read hers first and was intrigued by your introduction of weight being a factor. I think this is a great idea to study further. Without doing the experiment myself my first thought was it probably would still siphon but there has to be a greater force acting on both containers. A greater amount of suction to begin the siphoning and a greater gravitational pull on the other side. 

I agree and got what you were explaining how areas of high pressure move towards areas of low pressure. I am just a little unsure why and how heat energy moves from warm areas to cooler areas. My 5th grade teaching experience tells me that warmer air moves more and spreads out more so than cooler air. Cooler air doesnt move or expand as fast. I would have to investigate more on the topic of the warm and cold air move until they share the same temperature. Interesting theory though. You brought up some great points or explanations. 

Through my observations and experiments I am in agreement that the sucking one end of the straw creates enough force or difference in pressure to allow a siphon to work. Like I said earlier without doing the experiment, I do believe that you can siphon liquids with a greater viscosity, you just need more pressure differential. (Might have to experiment with this one)

 

I was curious about the introduction of bubbles. I agree that the bubbles would stop air flow, it is a break in the energy that is happening.

&lt;strong&gt;Question #1:&lt;/strong&gt;

To me, suction is a reduction of pressure.  When suction is taking place from one end of the tube, the pressure is taken out of the tube so that the area can be filled with the fluid (in our case).  It removes the pressure the air has within the &ldquo;walls&rdquo; of the tube, creating a space to be filled by something else.   I can&rsquo;t make that connection with the suction as pulling - what is it pulling on to bring the fluid in?  Is it like an invisible rope?  In my mind its the removal of the air so that the space can be taken up by something else.

 

&lt;strong&gt;2.  What is the role of gravity?&lt;/strong&gt;

The first scenario ~ gravity pulls down on the water in the reservoir, creating pressure at the bottom, which pushes water into the siphon tube at that end.  If that pressure is greater than the pressure at the other end of the tube, the water flows ~ is how I am thinking of gravity&rsquo;s role in the siphon.  When the pressure at the end of the tube is &ldquo;removed&rdquo; by suction, the pressure at the bottom of the container is able to &ldquo;push&rdquo; the water into the tube.  But I feel the need to add that it isn&rsquo;t necessarily a &ldquo;push&rdquo; but more that because the pressure is released at the other end of the tube, the water is &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to move into the vacated space.  Like its in search of a less restricted space (less pressure).  I think once it begins to move into the space, gravity then pulls it downward.  So I guess the way I look at it is that is a little of &lt;u&gt;both&lt;/u&gt; schools of thought.  The pressure begins the process, allowing the space to be vacated, once the space begins to fill, because the water is then headed in a downward direction, gravity takes over.

I agree with you when you say there is a void to be filled. But in my mind Im not so sure of the pressure being greater at the end of the tube. I was just thinking, maybe its more that the pressure is greater at the top. Consider this; if pressure is greater at the end and lower at the beginning, then wouldnt water be pushed up the hose and not down? Just a though. I was more considering that pressure pushes water down to the end of the hose. What are your thoughts?

So would that revert back to the pressure having to be released from the end of the tube (where we want the water to come out), and if thats the case, then would it just be a case of gravity continuing the flow once it got moving through the tube?

Youve made some great points.  I am intrigued by the potential energy portion of siphoning.   The way that I am understanding the point is that the higher potential energy resides in the higher container, the container that has the water looking for something to act upon it.  As soon as the water is pressured into the tube, it starts to become kinetic energy,  and as it settles into the lower container, it then transitions back into potential energy.

            I think that the act of actually sucking on the end of the siphon tube is a pulling force.  Your mouth, or other aparatus, it litterally pulling air out of the end of the tube.  In this part, sucking = pulling air.  However, by pulling air out of the end of the tube (or sucking) you are creating an area of lower pressure at that end of the tube.  If you suck on one end of the tube, creating an area of lower pressure, and stop sucking before the liquid reaches your mouth, the siphon will still work because of the pressure differential between each end of the tube. 

            Atmospheric air pressure is creating a pressure force on the liquid in the begining container.  The pressure is created because the air actually has mass that is being pulled down by gravity.  (Less mass than the liquid in the container, so the gas was diplaced to a location above the liquid - just to tie in our previous balloon converstations.)  In order for the liquid to defy the force of gravity and move upward in the tube, there has to be another force that is stronger than the pull of gavity on the liquid.  This force is the pressure of the atmospheric air pushing down on the liquid in the begining container COMBINED WITH the area of lower pressure that was created at the far end of the tube by sucking the air out.  Nature will try to reach a state of equilibrium.  When there is lower pressure, the area of higher pressure will try to move toward the area of lower pressure.  This pressure differntial is enough to overcome the force of gravity and allow the fluid to move upward in the first half of the tube.  Once it reaches the apex of the tube, the pressure differential AND the foce of gravity are now working together to move the fluid downward.  Now the liquid can fill the second container.   

 

To answer question # 2:

            I dont agree with the statement: One is that gravity pulls down on the water in the reservoir, creating pressure at the bottom, which pushes water into the siphon tube at that end.  Gravity is pulling down on everything, but this doesnt create a pressure at the bottom which pushes water into the siphon tube at that end.  If gravity is pulling &lt;u&gt;down&lt;/u&gt;, how can it push the liquid &lt;u&gt;up&lt;/u&gt; the tube?  This doesnt make sense to me.  However, I do agree with the second half of this arguement, if that pressure is greater than the pressure at the other end of the tube, the water flows.  As I explained in my answer to #1, this part supports my arguement about pressure differentials being used to overcome the force of gravity in the first half of the siphon tube.

            I also dont agree at all with the second arguement:  that the water flows because gravity pulls harder on the water in the longer side. That is, the side with more water weighs more, so it &ldquo;wins,&rdquo; like a heavier person on a see-saw: that&rsquo;s the side that goes down.  Why would gravity pull harder on the water in the longer side?  In this arguement, what makes the water move up the siphon tube on the resivor side to let it reach the longer side?

I agree with the confusion about where is the pressure greater. If you think about it, at the bottom of the ocean the pressure is greater due to the weight of the water from above. I thought about this and contemplated the notion that pressure must be coming from the top thus making pressure at the bottom greater. But I dont think that is the case here. There has to be lower pressure at the bottom creating a vacuum affect thus causing high pressure at the top, almost like pushing water out through the tube. Or maybe like pulling water out the tube. I think its more like pulling and with the help of gravity, water flows out.

Now all we have is pressure. Think about this. Eliminate gravity and all you have in an unbalanced force of pressure. Oh, we also have space to be filled by a fluid. Once we move a fluid in a specific direction through a tube from an area of high volume to an area of low volume, would it continue until the primary vessel is empty? Would it work at all?

I agree that gravity plays a huge role in our siphon scenarios but I also like the way that you referenced pressure as the mover of the liquid in the siphon.  Gravity is the force that is creating these changing pressures based on how we arrange our siphon.   Recall that liquids have indefinite shape.  Also that gravity acts on all matter so therefore liquids will always seek the best shape that allows the liquid to follow the force of gravity until it is stopped (perhaps by a higher pressure).  At the end of the experiment, siphons flow down, never up.  That would simply be a pressurized hose.  It is the nature of fixed volume of liquid that keeps the siphon running and that pressure difference remains drawing more liquid into the siphon intake.  (I think that I just made this more confusing because now I am wondering about what happens to a liquid as you continue to exert negative pressure on it in a closed container?)

I agree that gravity is affecting the siphon two ways. Suction is a term that is used to simply explain the movement of the fluid. Gravity is pulling at both the air and the water.

Gravity is playing a larger role than I previously thought.

Id hadnt believed that gravity would &lt;strong&gt;pull&lt;/strong&gt; the water out of the up spout as it went out the down spout, but Donnas rainbow experiment proves that it does.  I still believe that air pressure has something to do with it and David put it best in his post this week.  David talks about air filling the vacated space once the water leaves.  This combined with Donnas rainbow experiment got me to realize this is more accurate because there is no holding tank to have air pressure pushing down on the water, but there is an end of the tube that can be filled with air as the water vacates that space.  Also, previous experiments have shown that if you put a lid over the holding tank the siphon will stop.  Thats because there is no air to replace the void after the water flows.  This experiment shows that having the air fill the vacated space is essential to the flow of the siphon.  Thats why it cant just be gravity alone that makes this work.

Love the experiment. I think you are correct in stating there is a correlation between the height of the apex and the flow rate due to friction. I myself have not considered this. I wonder though if the intake length was the source of the rate of flow with friction. I mean that the longer intake, due to friction, had a lot to do with flow rate. I read your experiment and was thinking that trying a shorter intake would somehow change the results of your experiment. I may not have read thoroughly through this but if you could adjust the intake as water was removed from the main reservoir. This might be difficult to do. But do you understand what I mean?

Gravity is definitely part of the movement of water when there is an uneven balance of water on one side of the tube versus the other. In addition to gravity, pressure is part of that equation. The pull of the atmosphere contributes to the movement of the water through the siphon. The air particles spread out due to the pressure and move up through the tube replacing the water.

Tonya, it seems like you were having the same struggles I was having and have now arrived at the same conclusions I have developed.  I would not have thought about removing the tubing from the rest of the system until we had the conversations during our face to face meeting.  These simple, but revealing experiments really permitted us to see the effects gravity has on the system. 

As far as apex height is concerned, I think Paul&rsquo;s experiments show that the height is negligible.  The water does have to travel further up hill.  This longer uphill trip would suggest a slower rate of flow.  However, there is more mass traveling on the downhill side.  The force on the downhill side should counter balance the force on the uphill side.  Therefore, the flow rates for a short or tall apex are similar.

HI Deanna &ndash; reading your broader explanation of the siphoning mechanism, I completely agree that both suction (change in pressure) and gravity are necessary forces for siphoning to occur.  I also agree that there must be unbalanced forces for the flow to occur.  I have been able to experiment with just the tubing in a rainbow shape and the full siphoning set up.  In both cases, the flow of water could be controlled by simply adjusting the balance of forces.  By adjusting the forces, the water could flow in either direction or remain statically still.  I hope this makes sense (visuals/pictures would probably help).

I am a very visual person and I am intrigued with your ideas about the shift of forces and energy.  I am having trouble understanding your description of these shifts in forces, energy, and low pressure vacuum and how it is assisting the flow.  I will be interested, during our next face to face gathering, to see if I can better understand this flow of thinking.

What is the difference between viscosity and surface tension?  Naturally, a more viscous fluid will flow more slowly during the siphoning process.  Viscous fluids are more resistant to movement and flow.  When I think of surface tension, I think of clinging.  For example, water molecules clinging to one another when they are being piled on a penny. 

Here is what I am now wondering &ndash; when the tubing is out of the holding tank in the shape of a rainbow, all of the water in the tube flows to the side with more water.  Why does the water on the other side of the tube follow?  I know it cannot flow backwards because an air bubble would be needed to disrupt the unidirectional flow.  Does the air entering from below (air is filling the space vacated by the water) assist with a pushing force because air is less dense and naturally rises?  Does the water flow because of an attractive force between the individual water molecules?

Seriously though, your explanation and related experiences are completely in line with what my reasoning has been up until today.

However, leave it to Vesal and Lama to poke at the group story with some more tricky questions.

I was against the argument in class that the water would not come out and couldnt wait to get home to try it out.  Much to my surprise, it did stay in.  During class we were talking about being kids and pushing the bucket (upside down) into the water to let it fill and pulling it up so the water didnt come out so that got me thinking that it might stay in the tube.  I just cant figure out how its able to do that.  Is it the pressure of the tube against the water?  So the shape of the tube holds the water in place while the air pressure below it keeps its stable?  I get the equilibrium part, there is an equal amount of either side of the apex.  When I did it here, it stayed in place and when I pulled the tube one way or another, the water flowed out due to there being more on one side or the other.  I just cant wrap my head around the water not coming out. I dont see the mechanism behind it and I saw it for my own eyes!

I want to respond to Donna also because I completely understand her challenge with why does the water not run out because I have wondered the same thing. I think Chris and Becky have stated the response to the apex arch question very clearly.  Gravity is the force that drives this problem and it is essentially in balance with the equal tube.  Now I am going to introduce another variable that might clarify Donnas point:  The water does not run out when it is at equilibrium because the air cannot replace the falling water. But, what if the diameter of the hose was 2 inches and not a 1/4 inch?  I am suggesting that the surface tension of the water forming a meniscus in the ends of the hose enables this equilibrium to remain static.  In the larger hose, the strength of the bubble would not be sufficient to halt the flow of water.  Once air gets in behind this lead bubble, the rest is going to come pouring out once the balance is upset.  My question now is: What hose diameter, is the diameter that this happens at where water gets in behind either bubble.  I think that the inverted arch could not handle a hose diameter much more than 1/2 inch or so without pouring out past the opening 
"
94904,1415720456,9,0,Fall: Week 9,,"Katie and Karen,

You provide a very clear and concise explanation of why water will remain in the tube when it is in its &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; shape. I think it makes perfect sense that water will remain in the tube unless equilibrium is disturbed, such as when the arch shape is imbalanced or if a hole is drilled in the apex, allowing air to replace the area that is occupied by water in the apex. Your description of the upside-down cup or bucket of water that is pulled up from the surface of the water after being submerged is very interesting. I remember doing this as a kid as well, although I cant recall ever being able to get the water to stay in the cup after its brim moves past the surface of the water. Paul offered an interesting explanation in his response to our paper that I think might apply here: The cup or bucket has a much larger diameter opening than a thin tube, so the surface tension of the water within the cup/bucket (or even a larger diameter tube, for that matter), may not be strong enough to hold the water in the cup/bucket. Once air can enter one side of the cup/bucket, as you mentioned, equilibrium is broken and the water flows out.

I too am surprised that intake length did not cause siphoning rate to increase as I would have predicted, as you mentioned, that a longer intake equates to a greater volume and weight of water at the end of the intake. I think your proposed explanation for why flow rate was actually lower (increased friction within the tube with greater intake length), is very feasible and it is not something that I can recall us accounting for in our investigation thus far. This, along with the possibility of the greater influence of gravity, seems to explain why the increased apex height resulted in a decreased flow rate as well. Although the downspout and outflow are longer, the increased length of the intake and upspout seem to counteract any potential increase in flow rate.

Im wondering if/how a larger diameter tube will affect the results of your experiments? I dont see a larger diameter tube affecting flow rate with a higher apex as there will be a higher volume of water in the upspout that gravity will have to overcome. However, I wonder if a larger diameter tube will have an effect on flow rate with a longer intake as I would imagine that friction would be reduced?

David, thanks to you we have all come to a consensus that air is required in the holding tank for the siphon to work.  At least I think we all agree.  I believe the air then creates an air pressure on the water causing it to escape as you stated into the uptake.  I was wondering from your response if you think the the air that fills the tank after the exiting water leaves puts more pressure on the water?   I totally agree with you that the intake valve is acting as an escape hatch as the pressure from the air makes it want to leave.  

In addition, your 1st experiment showed that if both tanks are in equilibrium with each other  the momentum of the water in the siphon will stop, showing that there needs to be a basis of the two being in an unbalanced state for them to work.

Your experiment along with Davids prove that when in an equal state in the tubes or in the holding tanks, the siphon will not work.  This at least we can all agree with.  I like to use the word in equilibrium.  Another part that you also verified as David did was that whatever side of the siphon has more mass, that is the direction that the water will flow.  I never thought of the air as particles pushing down in the holding tank.  I always thought of it as air pressuer, so that puts another picture in my mind.

I can agree to the level of frustration and trying to find other investigations to explain our thinking. What did you mean by it can be reversed when the outflow is converted to the intake and vie versa?  I am trying to develop a picture of this in my head.

You said suction has to start the flow, like a vacuum.  However if we were to submerge a tube in the fluid, the siphoning process will still happen.  Do you still consider the submerging suction? I also would like to know what you mean you say viscosity is a property that allows the liquid to cling to the tubing.  I am not challenging this thought, i just do not know what you mean when you make this claim.  I know that the viscosity will affect the rate of the flow, but I did not consider the ability to stick to the tube.

As I read through your experiments, you found that apex height did not increase the flow rate (or friction offset it).  I start to wonder about the debate that is ongoing whether it is gravity, air pressure, or a combo of the two that causes the siphon to flow.  I start to wonder if the length of the downspout would increase the flow rate.  One would think so if they believed with the argument that gravity plays an important role in the flow of the siphon that the longer the downspout the faster the flow would be because there would be more water on this side therefore more gravitational pull.  I don&rsquo;t know the answer but wonder.

The discussion of how you need both gravity and air or air pressure for the siphon to work made me start wondering.  When you refer to air pressure and gravity playing a part, I am curious what you mean by air pressure?  I agree that air has something to do with it, that there needs to be air allowed to fill the holding tank as the water moves into the siphon tube&hellip;but is this air pressure?  I guess, I don&rsquo;t really know what air pressure it, I mean I know that air needs to be present to fill the empty space but is it air pressure that causes the siphon to flow or just the fact that air needs to be there.   I mean, is it the pressure of the air that allows the siphon to flow or just the fact that a suction is not being created in the holding tank (by having a lid on it) as the water flows through the tube and the holding tank is emptied?  Just some thoughts I have been struggling with understanding and your paper made me think more about them.

After reading your paper I am certainly still convinced that gravity plays a major role in siphoning. It made sense when you mentioned that due to gravity the water is being pulled to the lowest point available. I agree, when Katie and I conducted our experiments we came to the same conclusion. I am still not convinced or sure about the role of air pressure though. How much air pressure  is needed and what if there are different amounts of air pressure at a given time or place. 

Thanks for the experiment showing a rainbow. Now I am curious why this occurs. I would have the same initial thoughts about what would happen as you did.

Your experiments are clear to me and I agree with your assertion that both gravity and air pressure both make a siphon what it is.  (IMHO- without both of those what you have is a liquid being pushed through a hose by a force.

Your discussion did get me wondering, however, what would happen to your second experiment an environment where there was gravity but no atmosphere.     I am not sure there is such a place so well have to do it in our heads as a mind experiment.

The way I see it your experiment #2 would start to flow immediately because the gravity would do the pulling on the longer side.  The air pressure would not affect either side of the tube and would therefore be at zero balance (equilibrium).  

By extension, I now think that the same would work on a full siphon.   Given the chance to work, a full siphon, with balance zero pressure areas on all sides and ends, then it should flow because there is not the pressure differential that your earlier test had when you covered the holding tank.

I also think that it is also due to equilibrium of pressure on both sides. I also think that the equal weight on both sides is equal. So this means that gravity pulls down on both sides with equal force due to the weight distribution. 

I think that if we sealed the outflow the water couldnt flow because only one substance could occupy space at one time  what I mean is air occupies a specific volume and water occupies the rest of the total volume  The total volume is finite  

Even if air pressure is greater nearer the outflow, the pressure of water is greater than that of air so it would have no affect. Also it relates to the volume of air and the pressure of air  the volume on top of the main reservoir is much greater as compared to the volume of air and pressure at the outflow

Wouldnt the process still continue, as gravity will still work in this case.  As long as the tube is position downward and the the receiving tanks is below the holding tank, the flow should not be interrupted. I say this because I dont know if there is a tight enough seal that wouldnt allow air to escape. I think air would find the slightest opening and move towards a less dense area.  

As for the water flowing, it think the rate of the water is why the water does flow from the outspout.  I think there is actually less air pressure when the water is moving faster (somehow) and therefore, water will flow. The air pressure goes towards the flow because there is less pressure and the water fills the container.

The water piglets are heavier than the air piglets making them fatter and lazier.  They loung around the bottom of the container and dont move as much as the air piglets do.  Because the water piglets are taking up all the space at the bottom of the holding tank, the air piglets are only left with the top of the holding tank to run, bump and thump.

Just like in the holding tank, the heavy, lazy water piglets hang out at the bottom of the straw intake area and the more bouncy, energetic air piglets fill the rest of the straw.  If we bend the straw and suck on the outflow part of the straw, well have sucked out many of the cute little air piglets from the outflow.  Becuase there are less air piglets here and more air piglets bumping and pushing in the holding tank, the water piglets would start to feel pushed up the straw.  But they cant go until more piglets (air, water or other) are allowed into the party in the holding tank.

The air piglets love to party, and so they continue to fill the party space, which is the upper holding tank.  The continue to pig pile on top of each other which creates a lot of pressure on the bottom.  Well, the bottom piglets hate this, as we would because who wants to be on the bottom of a pig pile?  They need to escape to reduce the pressure that is on them.  They seek a way out of this mess, and low and behold, there is the intake valve.  They begin to be pushed up the intake valve, and as they are pushed more air piglets continue to pile into the party, meaning they continue to fall into the upper holding tank to take the place of the air piglets that have left the party (intake valve).  The pressure continues to build, thus continuing to displace air piglets up the intake valve, pushing towards the apex.  Once this party hits the apex, gravity takes over, plunging them down the downspout.  

Additionally, if you shut the door to this party (meaning put a lid on the upper holding tank), no other party pigs can come in, thus ceasing the problem of the air pressure, thus stopping the siphon.

I finally feel like I can get a grasp on why this pulling over the hump (apex) with gravity didn&rsquo;t make sense to me.  Not that what I am about to explain will make any more sense, but it will appeal to my common sense compass.

In the open container, the air piglets are all over the place.  And although air and water are both fluids, there is a difference.  I mean the water piglets do not pile up like the air piglets, as in the siphoning experiment there was a set volume.  The air piglets continue to build and build, applying the pressure and the pushing on the water piglets.  The water piglets are not happy and feel uncomfortable and they want out.  The only place to go is in the straw and over the apex.  This is when gravity finishes the job and why the siphoning process continues.

So now I think about adding a lid to the mechanism.  When the lid is added the pressure from the air piglets is less intense.  The air piglets are now building on the lid, but not on the water piglets, and so the siphoning process will stop because the water piglets do not feel the pressure to escape.

I agree that  the air piglets on the downspout do overcome the gravitational difference caused by the unequal amounts of water on each side of the siphon tube. This difference in water dictates the direction in which the water will flow. The side with the greater amount of water is being pulled with more force, therefore the water flows out of the siphon on that side. The air piglets do collide with each other and that increased pressure causes them to seek an area of less pressure.

I think for me, it would require the suction at the other end first (obviously) because just the air pressure alone wont get it moving, so Im wondering how it keeps going.  If the air pressure itself isnt enough to get it going, how does it keep moving?  In the downspout, gravity pulls on the water as it comes out (because theres more on that side as long as it is below the water line in the holding tank) - how does it keep moving up?  Do you think its the air pressure alone?  I think it has to be the combination of the forces pushing and pulling at the same time.

As I wrap my head around your description Jenn, I keep thinking about the different places in the story/mechanism we can start from.  The movement of the fluids (both water and air) is definitely a combination of pushing and pulling.  Your description seems to suggest that this is happening in unison.  I think I need to adopt your line of thinking.  I want to quantify the two forces.  I want to see if one force starts the siphoning and then another force takes over.  For example, (if there was a way) put the siphoning system in a bell jar and turn on the vacuum.  If the siphoning could be started, would it continue in this vacuum environment?  Could the siphoning occur if one force is removed?  I have been discounting the role air pressure plays, but I am starting to believe that the two forces actually do work together.  Your analogy has helped a lot &ndash; thank you.

the suction begins at the outflow from a source to start the flow. It wont start on its own.
	Once the flow begins the piglets flow down the out flow and gravity takes over.
	Piglets are now being pulled into the intake end.
	Gravity pulls down on the piglets in the outflow because there is more weight in this end.
	The flow continues until there is no liquid/piglets left to move from the main tank.
	a closed system would limit the volume of piglets in or out of the system so there would be no flow.

You are probably correct about the pressure being great at the intake due to the piglets rushing in. But I was thinking about the difference in pressure. Like where would the pressure be greatest?

HI Colleen &ndash; I have been thinking a lot about the role that air and gravity play in the siphoning process.   As I think more and more about what you and Jenn have been describing, I am getting a better understanding of the mechanism (I think).  Your description nicely describes the force air pressures plays at pushing water up the intake and how the air pressure increases with added air as more space becomes available above the water due to the water leaving the holding tank and entering the intake.   By adding the lid the force of gravity and the siphoning process being halted may have finalized some confusion for me (I think).  Do you think the siphoning would continue if there was no lid but there was not air pressure as well (vacuum?)?  Can gravity alone keep the water siphoning once the process has begun?

I do need some clarification &ndash; at the end of your paper you mentioned the air piglets get displaced up the intake.  Earlier you said the air was pushing the water into the intake.  Did you mean that the water was continuing to be displaced into the intake as more and more air piglets piled on top of the water?

I agree with you that unless there is a change in air pressure, the introduction of air piglets this is why the siphon stops working when you have a sealed holding tank.

But, you describe the pig-pile under then ends of the rainbow, when you pin prick the apex, the pig-piling is still under the ends of the rainbow&hellip;how all of a sudden can the water now run out into that pig-pile?

I tried this inside a vacuum pump and it worked. The liquid flowed. What does this mean? Im not sure but the suction was present even without air. So now theres the question. Why does this work with out air pressure? I think it works because the air inside the tube was being sucked out and in place of it was the liquid. I dont know for how long it would work. Maybe it would stop only when there is no more liquid in the main tank.

Great job with the response and you brought up some great ideas that may have clarified the pressure questions I had.  First off, I too am thankful for the water piglets story as it really helped me to envision what may be going on with the siphon.  I originally wrote that I believed the air piglets put a ton of pressure on the water piglets (without the lid), like a pig pile, which eventually drove the water  piglets up the intake valve.  Your point in regards to the lid being on and creating an even bigger pressure may make more sense to me so Ill have to think upon this much more.  I never factored in the lid, other than when it is applied, there are no more air piglets invited in.  In addition, I also agreed that once the piglets are pushed up to the apex, the gravitational pull from the downspout would take over and pull the piglets into the lower holding tank.

98406,1416875883,2,1,Fall: Week 11,...predict that the increased air pressure inside the holding tank will...,"This is a very fascinating experiment, Dave, and Ill look forward to hearing your results. I predict that the increased air pressure inside the holding tank will indeed force water up into the accepting straw (at least to a point), even if stoppered, so long as all of the seals you listed in your diagram are extremely tight. You will have created a more or less perfectly closed system by sealing all possible points of entry/exit for air and water molecules, so water will be forced into the accepting straw as additional air is added to the system. I dont think that the water will push all of the way up to the stopper, as air molecules occupy the accepting straw above the water line. I predict that the air molecules in the accepting straw will reach a point where they cannot become any more compressed (too many air piglets in one area), and that is the point at which water will stop flowing up the accepting straw.

In terms of your question about mechanism (&ldquo;Does the siphoning occur because the air must enter to replace the space vacated by the water or the air is actually responsible for pushing the water along as gravity pulls it along?&rdquo;), I believe that siphoning occurs because the air must enter to replace the space vacated by the water, hence the reason why siphoning did not occur when the holding tank was sealed. My original thought was that air pressure was the primary mechanism that caused siphoning to occur, but I now believe that it is more a lack of sufficient air pressure in the holding tank creating a vacuum of sorts that causes siphoning to cease. This vacuum overcomes the gravitational pull on the water in the downspout/outflow.

I found your explanation of an imbalance in air pressure on either side of the siphon tube causing water to draw up into the upspout to be helpful. This is part of the mechanism that we have been a bit stymied on (how does water &ldquo;defy gravity&rdquo; to flow into the upspout?). I agree that the greater volume of water in the downspout and outflow weighs more and, as such, gravity has a greater impact on the water on that side of the siphon. I read the following numerous times as I think it is really important in answering the questions that I still have about the role of air pressure, but I might still need some clarification: &ldquo;The gravity pulling the water out the outflow tube also causes the water which is now flowing away from the up spout side to resist the air pressure on the air at the up spout end with a smaller force. This imbalance of air pressure is what is causing there to be no vacuum allowed inside of the tube. The faster the flow of water the less the water in the tube is pushing back on the air on the up spout side causing an equally increasing up flow of water into the siphon tube.&rdquo; So this is saying that, as water flows through the tube and out of the holding tank, there is less air pressure on the holding tank side of the siphon, so water will flow against the downward force of gravity an up into the upspout?

I really like the idea that you presented about the piglets only being able to spread out a certain distance from one another. I think this is what we were actually trying to express in our response for the week, but you did a much better job describing it! Were thinking that water siphoning from the holding tank increases the size of the corral that the air piglets can roam in. They dont like being piled on top of one another, but they also must not like having too much distance between each other, otherwise water would continue to siphon in a sealed container, making the corral larger for the finite number of air piglets.

  Yes, I think the pressure inside the lid is what it is until its allowed to change.  I think the air pressure would remain constant - without a change, the flow could not continue.  When the hole is poked in it, it allows for air to enter the mechanism and make the siphon begin again.

And, yes to the second question as well.  If the balance of the water in the rainbow remains perfect, the water will remain inside it.  If it shifts in any way, then the water comes out.  At least it did in my primitive experiment.  The pinprick would make the same thing happen that we are talking about in the siphon, it allows that air to enter the system and changes the balance.

I am a little confused by something you said about volume. You said the volume is constant, that it doesnt change, but you also said the new space created. I think that the manipulation of the volume, increase and decrease, has an affect on the pushing of the piglets. Just a thought.

One more thing. I have not considered the piglets outside pushing in on the syringe when he pulled on the opposite end. That makes total sense. So maybe just maybe, When he pulls on the plunger the piglets inside push toward the new space at the same time the piglets on the outside push the plunger in. That makes sense to me.

Karen Santos

 

My first thoughts of the &ldquo;weirdo siphon&rdquo; were that the &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of Air Piglets inside the sealed tube was constant, the Air Piglets were trapped inside with no chance of escaping and no more Air Piglets would be able to get inside because the siphon was sealed. I thought that if the amount of Air Piglets did not change then the amount or distribution of the air pressure needed. I was sure that the black section of the syringe would move up and down in opposite directions when pushed or pulled. If one side was pushed into the syringe then the other side would be pushed lower into the syringe and vice versa. Although I knew this would happen I didn&rsquo;t give much thought to how and why until now.

 

When the plunger is pushed:

 

What I think is happening is that the force that is applied to the plunger (pushing) is greater than the pressure of the air piglets pressing down on the plunger. As we have discussed before, the air piglets don&rsquo;t like the pig pile affect. When the plunger is being pushed the pig pile increases causing the air piglets to move to an area where there is less pressure. They take the path with the least resistance. I think that when they move to the area of less pressure another pig pile occurs which causes the syringe on that side to be pushed down into the syringe. I think this happens because now the force or pressure of the air piglets is greater on that side and it is enough to push the plunger down into the syringe.

 

When the plunger is pulled:

 

When the plunger is being pulled you are creating an area of less pressure which is where the air piglets want to go. They do not like being in a pig pile. When an area opens up they move to it. (Pulling on the syringe creates an area of less pressure) The air piglets on the bottom of the pig pile begin to push the piglets above them to the side where the syringe is opening up more space for them.
