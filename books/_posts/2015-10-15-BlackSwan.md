My Summary:

A masterpiece by Nassim Taleb. A riveting focus on the implications of rare events. Told via brilliant stories and vignettes.

Quotes: (I did not take enough notes on this one…)

The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” and the others—a very small minority—who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones.
