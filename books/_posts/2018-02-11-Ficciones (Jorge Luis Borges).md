My Summary:

Jorge Luis Borges is a brilliant man. Read this book now.

Quotes:

There is no intellectual exercise which is not ultimately useless. A philosophical doctrine is in the beginning a seemingly true description of the universe; as the years pass it becomes a mere chapterif not a paragraph or a noun in the history of philosophy.
