My summary:

Quite possibly the most influential book I have read to date. The 48 Laws of Power is a thorough discussion of the laws and techniques that powerful people have used over the last 3000+ years to persuade others into doing their bidding. Each law is flushed out with fantastic stories about characters such as Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Henry Kissinger, and P.T. Barnum. Even if you don’t want to follow these laws, they will be used by others against you daily, so it is important to know what you are up against. Each chapter is a gem, detailing laws such as, Law 1: Never Outshine the Master, Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness, and Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally.

Quotes ( I wish I took more, I’ll have to reread this book):

It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900

The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatly valued.

Bad luck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think your brillliance will carry you through.

The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally.
