I treasure my mornings. A warm cup of [tea](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Tea-Moroccan-Mint-8-Ounce/dp/B004M1O1GW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1507836672&sr=8-1&keywords=Moroccan+mint+tea+tao+of+tea), and good book help me transition from the sleep world to reality. Inevitably, time passes and I must change locations and move along with my day. 

In order to extend that blissful period, I need to know when the next subway will come and take me away. Checking my phone or computer pulls me into a into distracted mental state, filled with email and social media distractions. Instead, I built this MBTAtracker. The piece sits passively in my kitchen, and constantly displays the remaining minutes until a subway train arrives at my local station. 

Each 'T' rotates to show the time remaing (think egg timer). The left T corresponds to inbound and the right to outbound. When the T is fully upside down, it signifies that a train is 15 min away. The T spins slowly until it reaches an upright position, signifying the train is arriving. 

This subtle motion lets me know when to leave my house in the most delightful way.
