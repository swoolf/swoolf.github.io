How can we let pseudo-randomness generate interesting images? I pondered this question as I learned how to interact with the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public){:target="_blank"}. 
I solicited the help of every single Twitter user, by searching a live stream of tweets for the words North, East, South, West, Red, Green, Blue. 

I began with a white canvas. Every time someone tweeted a cardinal direction, I moved my cursor. Everytime someone tweeted a primary color, I drew a dot. Over the course of five minutes, my canvas was filled with designs. 

If you're curious, check out the [code](https://github.com/swoolf/TwitterArt){:target="_blank"}.
