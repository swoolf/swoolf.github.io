How can we get students to document their own work? This is a question I’ve been pondering during my time working at the Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach (CEEO). Often, asking a child to document their thoughts is a battle, as the act feels counterproductive to the project he or she is working on. I’ve attempted to remedy this struggle, building a piece of technology that excites kids to document their work.

The Documentation Photo Booth is a tool that spurs organic student project documentation. The technology motivates children by providing a novel documentation environment, as well as returning a physical printout for the child to keep and share. Additionally, all of the student generated data is sent to a teacher or an evaluator, allowing him or her to get a snapshot of the students work.
