## Enchanted Objects ##


As the world fills with internet enabled technologies, our happiness depends on more thoughtful and human-focused designs. We don't always need a screen and a keyboard. Often, a quick glance can give us all the information we need, avoiding a deep dive into the infinite rabit hole of a laptop or smart phone. The following details several objects that I feel help bridge the gap between technology and humanity. Devices that, I hope, delight the user and are welcomed into our homes and lives. 

Credit needs to be given to David Rose and his book _Enchanted Objects_. His thoughts and ideas reasonate with what I have attempted to accomplish here.
