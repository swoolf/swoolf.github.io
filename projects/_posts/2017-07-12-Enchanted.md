## Enchanted Objects ##


As the world fills with internet enabled technologies, our happiness depends on more thoughtful and human-focused designs. We don't always require a screen and a keyboard. Often, a quick glance can give us all the information we need, avoiding a deep dive into the infinite rabit hole of a laptop or smart phone. The following details several objects that I feel help bridge the gap between technology and humanity. Devices that, I hope, delight us and are welcomed into our homes and lives. 

The name [_Enchanted Objects_](http://enchantedobjects.com/) comes from a book written by David Rose. His thoughts and ideas reasonate with what I have attempted to accomplish here.
