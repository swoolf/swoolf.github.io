Recent awesome picture: <br>
A few doors down from me sit a pair of brilliantly tilted houses. Each seem to lean a good fifteen degreees away from each other. I'd love to add a bit of smile inducing art. Perhaps a square and arrow accross the street (where this photo was taken), inspiring others to notice the buildings. Or maybe a sculpture of the Incredible Hulk, pushing the buildings apart.
