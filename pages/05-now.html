On a flight from Slovenia to Istanbul, a met a brilliant French artist name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Jeener">Patrice Jeener</a>. He has spent the last 60 years making mathematical art. His method is to engrave a copper plate using a scalpel, and then make ink prints on paper. After the flight, he was kind enough to gift me one of his pieces. 
This one displays a minimal surface in the form of a wave.
